Why does Amazon still let this company sell products through the Amazon Marketplace with so many angry customers? Also, the product KeyGrabber USB KeyLogger 8MB Black is a piece of junk and does not work. If and when it does work, it does not capture the data from the keyboard that you need. Many online banking sites somehow block this device from capturing anything. I checked with my bank, I was told because of the way the site is coded, the device will not work. Since IE9 does not save my username and password either, everything on the market for this industry is dead. With so much technology out, it is really amazing the United States has no more people / programmers / developers / computer engineers with any brains left.'"

              "\"I was hesitant to buy Turbo this year after having left to buy TaxCut last year when Intuit had the arrogance to put spyware into their product and add a disturbing activation process. I had always been a Turbo user but was so incensed at last years shenanigans by Intuit that I switched to TaxCut (and would do so again, should they initiate the same nonsense as they did in 2002). In any case, TaxCut in not even remotely as user friendly or robust as Turbo and given the opportunity to have Turbo as it was in 2001 and prior I have gladly come back. After reading the reviews on Amazon I hesitated, but am glad I gave it a try. The installation (on a Win 98 machine)was flawless (except for a minor glitch of it crashing my system when updating the software the first time). Useability is as good as always, in my opinion, which as I've said is light years ahead of TaxCut. In light of the options available on the market, Turbo is the clear choice (unless you want to suffer with a lesser product like TaxCut -- which I will grudgingly do again if Intuit plays games like they did in 2002!)\""
