Texture.....much creamier texture than most brands and melts smoother when warmed up. 3. Taste...I know a lot of cooks and chefs prefer a more neutral flavor but I personally love the more pronounced smell and hint of coconut. 4. Versatility...with the everyday user in mind I love to use this oil for popcorn, sauteing veggies or roasting as well as using as a scalp and hair treatment and makes for a wonderfully gentle makeup remover esp for the hard to budge waterproof mascara...be sure to rinse away from eyes very well tho...can block the delicate pores!

Much better material than other ankle sleeves I've tried, it seems very solidly made. Support is okay, but you shouldn't depend on an ankle sleeve for support. Inversion sprains are just as likely--you need a sturdy lace-up ankle brace to prevent those. This is for warmth and compression, similar to why bikers wear spandex tights. Support seems better than ankle sleeves with an open heel though, however, the top part of this ankle sleeve digs into the top of my ankle bone, where it creases when I dorsi-flex my ankle. So its uncomfortable when I run with it on.

Omron Body Composition Monitor with Scale - 7 Fitness Indicators & 90-Day Memory,Health & Personal Care,2,0,2,N,Y,Is it demotivational or dysfucntional?,"I was very excited to purchase the Omron Full Body Comp Scale. It appeared to be state of the art and with its 4 point of contact I was hoping for extremely, or more accurate body fat numbers. In 24 hour spans there were BODY FAT swings of 4% or more. I know from being involved in fitness that these types of swings are highly improbable, some would say impossible.<br /><br />The scale also has an \\""Age\\"" feature, which uses an algorithm that produces your \\""Body Age\\"". As someone who trains 5 days a week and engages in a very active lifestyle my \\""Age\\"" was consistently 80 years old!<br /><br />I am starting to believe that our technology just is not yet available to offer a cost effective methodology of accurately measuring body fat. I have used Omron before and they get high grades in construction and durability. My hope was for a device that if not record accurate BODY FAT measurements at least record consistent records so you could gauge if you were moving in the right direction. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case.<br /><br />So there is frustration in trying to gauge my actual fitness levels using this scale - though it does appear to run a true and accurate body weight. Additionally, while the body age feature was an attractive lure for motivating me to get back to High School fitness level it would appear to have the opposite effect and rather than getting fitted for my High School Letterman Jacket had me thinking of getting fitted for dentures and depends!",12/30/1899,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

Bort KubiTal Padded Elbow Bursitis & Tendonitis Sleeve,Health & Personal Care,4,1,1,N,Y,Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Sufferers Will Like This Sleeve,"I am in search of the ideal elbow sleeve to relieve the pain of cubital tunnel syndrome. When the sleeves provided by my physical therapist came up short when it came to pain relief, I decided to try this sleeve. So, here goes with what I like about this sleeve: - It is sturdy. - Generous gel padding helps protect the ulnar nerve from being aggravated and causing the pain. - Sleeve fits snugly and doesn't move around on the elbow. - Sleeve fabric quickly adjusts its fit to your arm instead of forcing your arm to adjust to it. - Offered in a nice, blue color along with beige. Now for the nits to pick: - It is pricey (but what cost is too much if it does the job well?) - Make sure you select the right size! The way Bort Medical sleeves, braces, and other devices are listed in Amazon does not include a size selection from within one web page. You have sift through all of the Bort Medical items available on Amazon (17 pages of information according to my searches) to find the product you want with the size indicated in its Amazon listing title. - Develops a funky smell after one day of use. It can be hand washed, but washing it once a day and letting it air dry isn't convenient.",11/3/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

"California Baby Hair De-tangler Spray - Calming, 8.5 Ounce",Health & Personal Care,3,13,16,N,N,"This did help add shine and definition to my baby's hair when it was short, but it doesn't help de-tangle.","I purchased this product last spring to help de-tangle my toddler's hair. Back then, she was only 14 months old and still had short (but curly) hair. Even then, this didn't really help us comb out the tangles in her hair. It DID help define her curls once her hair was already combed, plus it did add shine - which was nice. I followed the directions on the bottle and used this when her hair was still wet. I also tried using a conditioner first and also tried using this when her hair was dry. It still didn't help de-tangle.<br /><br /> Now that she's 22 months old, she has hair that goes almost down to her shoulders when it's wet. Her hair is fine and she has lots of tight Little Orphan Annie curls. With her hair now being longer, this stuff no longer does anything for it at all. In fact, I'd say that it even dries her hair out. After using this, her hair turns into a frizzy mess in a matter of hours. Her hair seriously looks better WITHOUT this product in it.<br /><br /> I do love that the ingredients are safe and this stuff also smells fabulous. The bottle lasts a long time. I really do wish it would work. However, I've now switched over to using California Baby Calendula Conditioner in her hair to help tame it - and that does work wonderfully - but I'm still hoping to find a natural de-tangler that actually does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />* (I use Earth Mama Angel Baby or California Baby shampoos on my baby. I use either Healthy Times or California Baby conditioner. I have very soft water and only wash my baby's hair a couple times per week. The only reason I mention this is to point out that my baby's hair care routine isn't overly harsh, so it shouldn't be making this product ineffective.)",11/12/2011,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

So, I decided to buy Pedi.Cure for my wife to try it out in hopes that maybe she could use it every once in awhile to supplement the spa visits. After one use, she was hooked! She would not stop talking about how great it made her feet feel and how happy she was that I bought it for herâ€¦ Which was good for me! She kept insisting that I needed to try it because I was having pain in my feet from running. Finally, I gave in and tried Pedi.Cure. I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase! I am ordering another one just so I can have my own because my feet are nasty. I will say, if you use too much pressure, it will not work as well. You need to lightly run the roller over the problem areas on your foot repeatedly and it will gently smooth out all dead and callused skin. My wife and I used the Pedi.Cure so much that we needed to order extra roller heads which arrived within days and were just as good as the first. Additionally, the customer service from the company was great. They answered all of my questions with their emails and I am a satisfied customer.

"Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein, 1.95 lb.

Cookies N Cream is easily the best flavor for this particular brand, which isn't saying much because the rest of the flavors a completely horrid. However, to this flavors credit, it does taste a little bit like the flavor that's labeled on the container.<br /><br />Despite what many people might think because of its price tag, Body Fortress is a high quality protein source and the fact that its Whey products are 52-60 grams of protein every two scoops is really impressive. The only problem that has plagued this product, is once again, the taste. This is really the only flavor from their Whey Protein Powder line that is actually somewhat easy to chug down, because the regular Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla and the awful Chocolate and Peanut Butter are not.<br /><br />So overall, this is the only flavor that gets a passing grade from me.",6/27/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Dickens Cider is the best drink i have ever found if served ice cold as it recomends,i was raised drinking \\""hard cider\\"" and it reminds me exactly of that.no after taste and no jitters if you don't drink more than 2 cans in 24 hours.as a club manager i put in 12-16 hr days at times,all my staff knew that at 11pm i would be comming behind the bar to get my can for the night,this allowed me to run the club till 2 am,close,oversee restocking and close out.by the time i got home at around 4 am i was able to shower and get a good nights rest.WHY WOULD DC BRANDS STOP OFFERING THIS WONDERDRINK?",9/6/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Nellie's All Natural Laundry Nuggets (30 Pre-Measured Packets),Health & Personal Care,5,3,4,N,Y,Nellie's Nuggets Work Great!,I love Nellie's Laundry Nuggets! Several members in our family have sensitive skin and Nellie's is okay for all of us. It works well on toddler clothes as well. Surprisingly so! I've put things in the washer thinking that with liquid soap I would always pre-treat a stain. Not needed so far - all our clothes come out clean and stain free.<br /><br />One user commented on the nuggets being hard. That is true for me as well. I put a nut cracker in the box of nuggets and just crunch up each nugget before I use it. It may not be a problem for machines where you add soap with the clothes. I use a front loader with a dispenser and we have had hardened chunks that did not completely dissolve. I'm able to crunch the nuggets with the nutcracker and it doesn't burst the outer pack. Just a few squeezes and the hardened nuggets are ready to use and dissolve easily with nothing leftover.,3/19/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Honeywell C7189R1004 Wireless Air Indoor Sensor,Home Improvement,2,1,2,N,Y,Updated review: Sometimes setup is troublesome,"I ordered 4 of these for 2 thermostats, and the setup and install for the first two was a breeze. There are some limitations as to how the thermostat will use the thermostats temperature, but thats really a problem with the thermostat, not this product. However, for the other two I had problems. During setup, the unit kept giving me an orange light, when the manual only mentions either a green or red light. Even if I assumed that the orange light was supposed to mean &#34;red,&#34; that didn't make sense. Red indicates a dead battery, and I used several fresh sets of batteries. I never could get one unit to install. I contacted Honeywell support, and since this is supposed to be a contractor installed item, they will not help. If you do purchase this item, make sure you install it immediately. That way if it doesn't work, you can just return without having to deal with honeywell support. There are reports that these units might work initially, but fail/stop connecting to thermostat in a year or so, so that is still a concern you must deal with.",7/13/2015,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Under Cabinet LED Lighting 21 LED 3 Panel Deluxe Kit pack-parent,Home Improvement,5,1,1,N,Y,Very easy,"I just finished installing this into an unlighted cabinet-- a great deal of fun watching things light up, cabinet and kids.

I do recommend the dimmer (LED 4-Position Dimmer Switch) which makes selecting the right amount of light easy. Everything is plug and play.

I might also pick up another 4 pack and try using these for my spring vegetable grow starts (just to see if they work since they seem as bright as the 6400K florescents).<br /><br />One thing I will caution you of is to make sure you have current tombstones that are non-shunted (tombstones are the end mounts in florescents).

He properly cleaned and prepped the deck and had recommended this noting the cost was worth it.<br /><br />It not only turned the silvered, rough boards a lovely pale cedar color (1/2 natural + 1/2 cedar mix). It also lasted until this to year when my deck had gotten very dirty and algae'd with the SC moisture and humidity. Just got the deck power washed this week to get all dirt and grime off. It's clean now and really surprisingly the deck boards are back to the nice cedar color! Amazing as I did literally no maintenance in 7 years.<br /><br />I'm now buying a couple more gallons to refresh it and re-seal again and expect another 7 years. Worth every penny just not to have to resell/stain deck every 2 years like I did in my prior home when I used Behring or Thompson stain and seals.

"LE 16.4ft LED Flexible Strip Lights, 300 Units SMD 3528 LEDs, 12V DC Non-waterproof, Light Strips, LED ribbon, For Garden/Home/Kitchen/Car/Bar, DIY Party Decoration Lighting",Home Improvement,3,12,15,N,Y,This about sums up what you're to expect from these LEDs....,"These LED strips have their ups and downs.<br /><br />It seems this is a common problem I've seen when buying these strips. The first 12v power cable interface is solid but the 2nd one (that's included in the package) seems to be either broken or on the point of breaking. Not to mention that i got my packages somewhat damaged which didn't affect the LEDs but could have caused damage with the power cables.<br /><br />Remember this: These are &#34;sticky&#34; strips and, if you don't go over them and keep pressing them down (the first few days) they may actually come loose. And whatever you do, make sure there is NO stress where the cable is connected or it will pull loose. An alternative might be &#34;stapling&#34; them into place where the power cables are attached to ensure they will not come off whatever surface they are attached to.<br /><br />How these units respond to very hot weather....I'm not there yet but they don't seem to lose their adhesiveness during cold weather. I'm in Alabama so summers don't get much more hot/humid here so i will update this in a few months.Still, as an alternative lighting source, i have to admit...these aren't bad.<br /><br />I would guess that if someone could develop a USB connector with a wireless switching system (or just toggle switches) this could make any RV, or possibly even a man-cave look really nice.. It's all about the direction they are being used and the angles. Also, having them project onto a &#34;white&#34; back surface has a much nicer effect.<br /><br />Oh, you might want to limit their burn period to a maximum of 16 hours, those 12v adapter get pretty HOT when the LEDs have been used for a long period of time.<br /><br />And, by the way, do NOT try to run 2 strips on one 12v adapter...you will probably get a burnout in 12-18 hours. Already made that mistake in hopes of getting two for one...won't work.<br /><br />I know people are planning on using these in cars but you had better make sure they are secure because, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it. Tough is something these LEDs are not meant to be.ause, if they fall, and are kicked or dragged, they won't endure it.

Frost King SP57/67 R6.7 SP56/67 Water Heater Insulation Blanket,Home Improvement,1,2,3,N,N,Total junk - didn't fit a standard 50 gallon tank,"As many others reported, this blanket, which claims it will fit around a 50 gallon tank, doesn't wrap completely around it. The tank is in a newer townhouse I bought, which I plan to move to after other work is completed inside. So, I looked it up on Amazon and as others stated, it doesn't fit many tanks and there isn't enough tape to completely seal the seam either. What's the point of not enclosing enough tape to seal the seam? Just so we have to buy a roll of some sort of tape to finish the job?<br /><br />I measured the circumference of the tank before buying a blanket for it, so I thought I had the correct product. How can this company claim it fits around one when it doesn't? So I measured the width of the blanket, and yes, it's the size stated, so not sure why it doesn't fit the tank. Luckily, I bought this at a local hardware store, to which I returned it, with no hassle, but the store didn't have anything else in stock, so I left without a water heater blanket. I then tried both HDs and the Lowe's stores in my city, but the only ones they had were the same thing, or nothing on the shelves. I guess they had sold out.<br /><br />Upon doing extensive research now, I've decided that a fiberglass blanket that's so thin, isn't going to be enough added insulation to make my water heater much more efficient (trying to reduce stand-by loss). So I'm looking for a thick mineral wool blanket instead. Mineral wool is both waterproof and more fireproof than this piece of junk.<br /><br />Remember to insulate your water pipes as much as possible too.

I sent the seller (Decorate with Daria) a note through Amazon and they called me back within a couple of hours. It turned out that my bidet had slipped a little bit off the mounting plate. The customer service woman Samantha was awesome and talked me through re-mounting the seat and now it works great again. Recommended product and recommended seller!

Lava Lite Grande 250-Ounce 27-Inch Lava Lamp,Home Improvement,5,3,3,N,Y,Get ready to pull out your old records...,"It's funny how you end up doing some of the things you do...this is a perfect example. I had been given a couple of smaller Lava Lites left over from a TV commercial, and as a goof we put one on top of a subwoofer in our home theater off to the side of the screen. My wife and I would catch ourselves staring over at it on commercials or during bad TV episodes or films. So when I found out there was a BIG A** version of it I just had to one-click it on Amazon.<br /><br />We have had a BALL with this thing-literally! We got the yellow and purple based on other reviews-It does have an excellent contrast of the colors, though I think it's kind of a drag not to be able to buy additional colored bottles once you have the base unit. Did I mention it is BIG?? NOT 250 ounces like the ad (That's almost 2 Gallons!)- The bottle is actually 57 ounces, so about the size of a two-liter bottle- a little wider on the bottom and and around 4\\"" taller because of the cone effect of the lamp shape. Patience is a virtue here; it does take over two hours to heat up to the point where it's dripping red ball shapes. Up until that time the wildest Formaldehyde Baby, hydrogen bomb cloud, Area 51 alien, and cellulite fat looking shapes ever imagined form at all levels of the lamp-which is cool on its own! And the amount of activity once it's fully warmed up is awesome as well- it's so big inside that seeing 6, 10, or more balls dripping while large ghost shapes are behind is common. As other reviews have said, make sure you center the lamp-another advantage is with this size one being so tall the actual bulb for the lamp is far enough off the base that you don't need to worry as much about heat damaging veneers underneath. We keep it on a black Paridigm sub for six hours with no signs of damage, but you're on your own here for your use. And the sub if if anything seems to help the experience. And we heeded the advise of another good reviewer and we do limit the total time to six hours, not the eight the one-sheet that comes with it says.<br /><br />Over a month now, and running 2-3 days a week, it's been fantastic. This is a blatant trick by Amazon to make me go buy SACD's of Dark Side of the Moon, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and a few other classic 70's LP's... and it WORKED!

Suncourt Flush Fit Register Air Booster Fan and Flush Fit Mount Adaptor,Home Improvement,4,37,41,N,Y,"Works well, with modifications","I have a wall heater vent that is about 40 feet from the furnace. The contractor that put in the bedroom addition decided to connect the duct to the end of a duct that already feeds two other rooms. In the past, I had to close the other two vents in order to feel any appreciable flow out of the end vent, and still the room was much colder than the rest of the house.<br /><br />Although this model is described as white in color, the booster that I received is closer in color to the gray outlet- and switch plates. As others have mentioned, it is somewhat loud, and removing the inner grates helped to some extent. On closer inspection, I found that one of the fans would not spin freely. I discovered that both fans were not assembled correctly. Specifically, the fan bearings were not pressed fully into the hub. When I looked at the gap between the fan (the rotating part) and the frame, I could see the coils of copper wire inside. Supporting the hub, I pressed each fan down until it seated fully. The blades sit much closer to the hub support arms. I noticed that both fans spin much more freely and the booster is noticeably quieter.<br /><br />The fans are model DFC902512M by coolingfan.cn, 12VDC, 0.20A. This model is not listed on their website, but a similar 92x92x25mm, 12VDC, 0.20A model listed has the following specifications: voltage: 6-13.8VDC, speed: 2500rpm, airflow: 48.1cfm, pressure: 2.60mmH2O, noise: 31dBa, weight: 77g. Tach measurements give the following fan speeds: low: 2000rpm, medium: 2200rpm, high: 2500rpm. At medium speed, the noise level seems comparable to that of the unboosted vents closer to my furnace. There is a more significant jump in speed and noise from medium to high than low to medium. I use medium.<br /><br />While the unit was open, I also desoldered the thermistor from the control board and extended it with a pair of wires by about 8 inches out the back. I was able to thread the two thin wires through the original hole for the thermistor and out of one of the rectangular access holes for the fan catches without the need for drilling an additional hole. The thermistor now sits deeper inside the duct. The unit no longer cycles on and off repeatedly at the start and end of the heater cycle due to the fan blowing directly on the thermistor. There is no hysteresis programmed into the controller, so the fans cycle on and off at exactly the set temperature.<br /><br />The LEDs for the indicator panel fit into tubular guides. You can inserted a small wad of cotton or tissue into each tube to dampen the amount of light emitted, and not alter the external appearance of the booster.<br /><br />The booster comes with a 12VDC, 500ma transformer-type wall wart. According to my Kill-a-Watt meter, it is drawing 1W at idle, 5W on low, 6W on medium, and 7W on high. Note that the fans are rated 2.4W each according to the labels, 4.8W together. When power is reset, the booster seems to remember the last-used settings.<br /><br />This booster fits best if the duct opening is flat and square. In my case, the metal duct extends slightly from the drywall and the spackling is uneven. Due to this protrusion and the design of the plastic faceplate and adapter, the unit does not sit flush against the surrounding drywall. I will have to either trim the duct and spackling flush with the drywall, or adhere a strip of thin foam insulation around the perimeter of the back of the faceplate to close this irregular gap.<br /><br />The room is warmer and comfortable with the booster installed and running. Considering the quality of parts and type of materials used, I do wish it was a little less expensive. I also had to order the adapter plate for larger vents, plus a 120VAC flat-plug extension cord so that it can be plugged into a wall outlet behind furniture.

My particular system uses a 2&#34; x 20&#34; x 20&#34; filter -- a size that is not readily available from the &#34;big box&#34; home centers. This proved to be a blessing in disguise, as it caused me to research what &#34;MERV&#34; meant -- and I discovered that the filters carried by local vendors were of rather low quality in the level of filtration. As an allergy sufferer, I was pleased to be able to purchase a higher level of filtration that should reduce the allergens moving though my home's air handling system. These filters appear to fulfill my needs very well and were quite reasonably priced.<br /><br />In my home, the furnace is in the attic, and the filter is positioned just behind a grill in the ceiling of a central hall. The measurements of filters tend to be slightly less than the nominal measurement, which made installation a 'three hand' situation. (Solved by turning on the system fan, allowing the air flow to hold the filter in place while closing the grill that holds the filter in place.) The filter does not firmly contact the sides of the filter box, but the duct behind the filter is slightly smaller, so that in operation, the air pressure holds the filter against the duct giving an adequate seal.<br /><br />The filter appears to be sturdy and should preform its task without structure failure.",6/18/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Cook'n Recipe Organizer Version 10,Software,4,2,3,N,N,Great customer support & great product,"I have been using Cook'n since version 7. It is an easy program to learn and use with lots of options. I live in Australia so the measures are metric rather than imperial. Last year I lost a good deal of data (includinging my personal recipe files) from a failed computer. This SHOULD have taught me a lesson.<br /><br />When I upgraded to Version 10, I had difficulties restoring my databases. This is not the fault of Cook'n, rather my own lack of diligence with backing up data appropriately. I have to start from scratch AGAIN with my Cook'n. Some recipes are lost forever I feel but maybe I have learnt with time to make appropriate backups.<br /><br />Getting back to the program, it can be as simple or as complicated as you like. I do not use menus or indeed shopping lists most of the time but I still come back to Cook'n for its ease of use and flexibility.<br /><br />The only beef I have with Cook'n is the printing side of things. As I am in Australia, paper sizes are not the same as the US but with a little tweaking, I can get around that. More printing options would be nice but that's on the wishlist.<br /><br />I must say that DVO's customer service is great. I lost my purchased cookbooks but the DVO team were able to resend me what ones they could considering that I purchased them over 4 years ago.

Adobe Premiere Elements 10,Software,2,3,5,N,N,Does NOT Make HD Movies for Legacy Players,"I have used five generations of Adobe Premiere, all the way back to version 1.5. While it is still a good editor with some strong features, the latest version, PE 10 flagrantly misrepresents its capability. It states on the box \\""Burn Blu-ray quality HD movies using standard DVD discs and burners.\\"" This statement is under the heading \\""Share videos...with friends wherever they are\\"". The problem is that your friends will have to buy a new \\""1080 HD DVD Player\\"" in order to take advantage of this feature. Adobe does not specify that their new feature requires new hardware and therefore it is misleading and caused me to waste a good deal of time trying to find an explanation on their website. Not to mention that the claim that it works with any HD video camera is simply not true. It worked with my older camcorders, but not my new Sony.<br />On the other hand, the software does a fine job of basic editing and is particularly good at rendering discs because it has good control over the menu text and icon placement and has an excellent DVD preview screen so you don't have to burn DVDs to know if your menus launch the scenes correctly. Rendering to all formats is impressively fast and the Win 7 64 bit implementation is robust and only crashes occasionally.<br />More problems with PE are caused by Adobe's strategy to attempt to persuade users to use this product as the nexus of all their stored video and still media. Anybody who is serious about video editing will have a host of programs including viewers, converters and other editors. PE's cumbersome attempt to grab all the media files results in screens popping up unexpectedly that take you out of the core editing experience. This was never the case in the older products. Bad product direction for serious video editors. Also bothersome are their frequent attempts to pull users into using the related suite of Photoshop products, no doubt because they are losing market share to Picasa and other free photo editing programs.<br />This product is now no better than the Cyberlink competitor and the only reason I remain an Adobe user is that I am familiar with their menus.",5/23/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Poser Pro [OLD VERSION],Software,1,10,13,N,N,"Quality OK for Freeware, but not for a $500 Product!","Review of Smith Micro's Poser Pro Well, at this juncture I've been working almost daily with this product, and thought it was high time I shared some of my impressions with other prospective customers/victims. First of all, as a long-time software professional, I am quite aware of the complexities associated with 3D rendering, and the high demand on processing resources -- both memory and CPU. Even though I'm running a fairly capable machine (quad-core, 64-bit, 8Gig of ram, 2 - 1-terrabyte drives, Win XP-64, etc.), I am prepared to accept that complex 3D scene rendering will take some time. That said, what I DO NOT accept is the necessity for the program to outright refuse to render, or even LOAD some scenes, reporting \\""not enough memory to load texture map'! In software engineering terminology, this just indicates sloppy memory management. Even after researching the issues, tweaking the render settings, running a 3rd-party memory management utility -- the problem persists. Perhaps even harder to excuse is the generally brittle nature of the package. It regularly becomes necessary to resort to ctl-alt-del, bring up the program manager, find the process, and use the \\""kill process tree\\"" command to get rid of the hung application, and then start the whole process over from the start, often losing work in the process. Then, of course, there are the incessant \\""An unexpected exception occurred: -50\\"" messages. Once again, ctrl-alt-del, etc., is the only way to proceed. Don't even bother looking in the event manager, or searching for a log that might explain the source of the problem. The Poser \\""engineers\\"" apparently considered such niceties as superfluous. Interestingly, it's often possible (and necessary) to load a scene that Poser Pro refuses to accept by using Poser 7! I can then eliminate some elements, save the file, and reload back into Poser Pro. Did someone decide it was necessary to introduce some additional bugs into the flagship package.? Ialso have a strong suspicion that the program suffers from some severe memory leaks. If you monitor memory usage, you'll see that, regardless of the nature of the scene, memory usage just keeps on increasing, until, inevitably -- that's right: ctrl-alt-del. The thing that amazes me most, is the proliferation of gushing reviews of this shoddy piece of . . . programming. Are the reviewers on Smith Micro's payroll? Have they done any more with it than render a quick naked woman, gawk over it, and then write: \\""WOW, what a GREAT product!\\""? There are, of course, so many other annoying quirks as to defy enumeration here. Suffice it to say, that this is an extremely irritating program with which to work. Smith Micro touts this as a \\""professional package,\\"" an utterly absurd assertion. It's quality is such that I might overlook the bugs in a freeware package, but certainly not in something costing nearly five-hundred bucks. Oh well, there's a sucker born every minute. Now, as someone who has watched my own company's profits eroded by software piracy, I am generally opposed to such abuses, however, in cases like this, my advice is to acquire the product from someplace like Emule, or Vuse, or other torrent servers, use it for a while, and if you still think it's worth the asking price, then by all means, write that check. Otherwise, just use it at a cost that's precisely what it's worth: $0.",7/8/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Microsoft OneNote 2007 - Old Version,Software,5,3,3,N,N,Absolutely Vital for this IT Manager,"I've been looking for a product like this all my working life. I started with OneNote 2003 and upgraded to 2007 as soon as it was available. I use it daily for everything from my To-Do list, to a daily journal for work and personal. It is handy to store the multitude of projects, notes, operating instructions, help desk notes, network notes, passwords, etc. I will never understand why Microsoft doesn't just include this with every Office package. It is like a best-kept secret. Hard to sell my office mates and bosses on this product when it costs extra to buy to add on to most Office packages. Come on Microsoft, this product is not only for students.

Rack 2 Filer V5.0,Software,3,31,33,N,N,Pretty and easy but proprietary database is not so great idea,"Received with ScanSnap S1500. Goods: 1. Relatively easy to use and organize without having to use windows file system. Good for the non-computer geek who just wants to get rid of the paper but have a things organized in binders and folders. Others: 1. To attempt to minimize software piracy (I don't blame them) there is a relatively complex installation which failed in my case on several attempts. Support helped me get around this problem within a few days and were very helpful and responsive. But, if I ever need to reinstall or move to another computer (if you are scanning your life aren't you going to take it with you to the next computer?) I can expect it to be difficult. 2. The main problem with this program is the proprietary database. The file and folder naming structure in windows is not representative of what you called the files and folders in the program when you scanned them (unlike the default program that comes with the scanner). This mean that you need to use the program to find the files and if you ever no longer have this program or access to it (see number 1 above or if you are using Windows 10 ten years from now and this program is no longer supportable), all your scanning work will be for naught and you will have a bunch of folders and files with gobledegook for names.

"Power PDF Standard, Bilingual English/French",Software,4,0,0,N,N,"Less Bloated Acrobat Replacement, but Quirks","I've used Nuance Paperport pro V12 and the bundled PDF program for a while on an older XP computer (soon to be retired).<br /><br />Power PDF is a significant step up that adds form creation, OCR features, conversion to/from PDF from lots of document formats, and adds a version of Dragon for adding notes to PDF's. It is at it's heart a PDF converter.<br /><br />Installation was completely uneventful. The registration/activation is a bit annoying but it seems the sort of the way the software world is headed. This hasn't always been the case for Nuance products. Paperport in particular was known for installation problems.<br /><br />Like most Nuance products I've used this has a quirkyness to its interface. If you have used other Nuance programs you'll know what I mean. If not you'll either get used to it or become frustrated. I think most people adapt without much trouble.<br /><br />In general I've used the PDF conversion features and some basic form creation so far. I've played a little with the dragon notes and it seems to work pretty well with my voice.<br /><br />The results seem to open on fine on Acrobat Reader XI and Acrobat Pro X..<br /><br />Power PDF installed and worked well. It has a broad set of features. The interface is Nuance &#34;quirky&#34; and the registration/activation is a bit annoying. So I'm giving 4 stars to Power PDF.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.",12/1/2014,0,0,i,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Quicken Home & Business 2013,Software,1,202,203,N,Y,Don't do it!!! Wait for the bug revisions - R11 still not it.,"I admit it, I got excited for the new version and upgraded. Nearly all the marketing features hyped above are not ready for prime time. Budgeting is a big fail. I'm going to revert to an excel spreadsheet and manually transfer the values. The numbers are off and there is an odd way of handling categories and future transactions.<br /><br />Mobile sync crashes around 50% of the time and takes roughly 5 minutes to complete, while the software is locked and unusable. I hit sync and walk away. Using the iOS interface took some getting used to, and I may use it \\""on the fly\\"" but it's not as nimble as the Pocket Quicken app in the days of Palm (yes, I'm that old and have been using Quicken that long!)<br /><br />I could go on, but the other reviews hit the high points. I came from 2011 and wish that I could go back, but I've put too much new info in the data file, so I'm stuck.<br /><br />If I could do it all over again, I'd wait to upgrade until users report all the kinks are worked out (if ever). Just head over to the forums and see what people are posting. I wish I did before I purchased. As of today (10/8/12) I have taken a step backward from usage. Thank god for Excel to fill in the holes while other people that purchased this too early \\""beta test\\"" for Intuit.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />EDIT 11/15/12: I just downloaded the seventh (R7) update and it completely corrupted my data. Mind you, I had to add a \\""balancer\\"" transaction to a few of my accounts with the upgrade to 2013. Amounts were off, but I couldn't figure out where or why.<br /><br />With R7, I had to restore from a backup (thank God I backup). If I could downgrade this review to zero stars I would. I no longer attempt to use the budgeting feature, we use excel and manually patch the data back into Quicken. I have mobile completely disabled (it added corrupt data). I bought a book to understand some of the \\""new features,\\"" if only to find a workaround.<br /><br />If I could go back to my previous version or if there was a reasonable competitor I would abandon this product immediately.<br /><br />--------------<br />EDIT 3/2/2013<br />--------------<br /><br />We're on R11 (patch 11) now. I'm happy to report that I haven't had any data corruptions recently--for a couple of months. The mobile/iOS experience is still not working. Now every time I try to use it recently I get a \\""Data Error\\"" and it boots me completely out. That is to say it requires that I go back an re-enter my UN and PW as opposed to simply the iOS program PIN. Then it simply gives the same error and requires a sign out. I may delete the account and create a new one, again, to see if that fixes it as it has in the past. As you can gather from my review above and other users, it hasn't been sufficiently reliable for me to consistently use it, so I can't say it's a huge loss for me. However, if you view it as a big selling point, don't purchase this software for this feature.<br /><br />There are many bugs that are still not worked out (again, venture over to Quicken's support forum). My view on the software is still the same. This is not an adequately vetted program and is still not ready for public release. If you MUST upgrade for some reason, such as banking compatibility, it's tolerable--at least you won't lose data (well, maybe). I still backup frequently. The only reason I'd say that's a remotely acceptable option is because there are no real competitors here. My rating stands at 1 of 5 stars.",10/8/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

I continually get an error message that the &#34;Sound Level is Too Low&#34; and I cannot even get past the profile setup wizard due to this error. The headphones included with the software are either junk, or the software itself has an error with Windows 7. A user forum I was reading mentioned that if you call Nuance with this problem they will spend plenty of time making sure you checked all the obvious solutions, then they apologize and tell you they have a software glitch they are working on. I haven't subjected myself to this process, and I don't plan on it, either. No product should require this much work just to get it to function adequately.<br /><br />Well, a glitch working with Windows 7 is a big deal.

I checked every single listed solution I was able to try, and I simply cannot get this software to run properly. If this is a known bug, as it seems to be, then this product should not be sold as compliant with Windows 7. I am returning this, there is no way I plan on spending even more time and effort getting this to work. I checked the microphone function with the Windows Sound Recorder, and while it is a bit low, it records just fine. So, either the issue is the included headset (hopefully Nuance is not hair-brained enough to send out a faulty headset that will make their software look like garbage) -or- the problem is that their software is buggy and doesn't run properly on my new, clean, non-buggy computer.",1/10/2013,0,0,i,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011,Software,5,6,10,Y,N,Easy to use somewhat powerful paint program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if u are not already one,"I loved this product. It's a paint/photo program, not a drawing program. Adobe Photoshop (AP) is a paint/photo program; Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a drawing program. AP creates bitmap files, and AI create vector files. Bitmap files are images made up of little dots. Whereas vector files are mathematical formulas that are easily scaleable. The native files for Sketchbook are stored in layered TIF format, but they can be exported in many different bitmap file formats: gif, jpeg, and PSD.<br /><br />I have used quite a number of different kinds of computer applications over the years: wordprocessing, spreadsheet, presentations, database, email, WYSIWYG Web page designers, paint/photo, and drawing. Of all these different types of computer programs I have had the most difficulty learning to use well the paint/photo kind. This is probably because I am not really an artist - at least not one adept at creating visual pictures using my hands. I am much better at taking photos with a digital camera and tweeking them using Adobe Photoshop. I have always found AP to be a tough cookie when it comes to creating original artwork from scratch.<br /><br />Sketchbook Pro makes it much easier for me to create original artwork from scratch. It is designed to be used with a digital pen tablet. The intuitive user interface is slick and pleasing to eye, and you will be up and running in no time using pencils, brushes, layering, and pan/zoom features. This product is going to make it easy for you to \\""sketch\\"" out a rough draft of the artwork you want to create. It will not create a masterpiece probably, but you can certainly move your file into AP and tweek your art to your heart's content.<br /><br />This product was easy for me to install, and it has never appeared sluggish to me when using it. I suppose the only problem I had with the product is its name. I think of the word \\""sketch\\"" as being a drawing. Thus at first I thought this was a drawing program. So don't be confused by the name. What you will get with this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one. And if you are already expert I suspect you will thoroughly enjoy this product to create the early-goings of a paint file you will fine tune in AP. 5 stars!this product is an easy to use somewhat powerful paint/photo program that will help turn you into a pretty good digital artist if you are not already one.

Music Ace Deluxe,Software,3,14,14,N,N,Fun for adults too,"I bought this software for myself (learning keyboard) but I also have children. The software focuses on learning how to read music and also locating the notes on the keyboard. It would be helpful for children/adults playing any instrument. Most of the lessons are based on learning the notes on the scale, counting beats, etc. Cons: The doodle pad composer does not save on my computer (I have vista) so when my son makes his \\""masterpieces\\"" I can not save them to listen to later. Also the graphics are very dated. There doesn't seem to be any competition for this type of software so I guess that is why it hasn't been updated. Overall I think this is a good game and slightly overpriced ( I paid 45 on here but feel 30 would have been a better price since the game is older) I have finished all of the lessons but go back and do the games to improve my speed with identifying notes on the scale and the keyboard.",1/7/2009,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I had lost a couple pounds but nothing near where I should have been for as much hard work as I was putting into exercise and strength training. I went to the DietPower website and downloaded a two week trial version for free. In those two weeks I lost five pounds simply because I had visibility to the calories I was taking in and what I was burning off through exercise. The software itself is rather complex but it is very simple to use. Logging foods and exercise is very easy and quick. It even helps you track your water intake based on demands from food and exercise. It helps track the nutrition in what you are eating so you have visibility to how much vitamins you intake and where you might be lacking throughout the day. This is great software.

Norton 360 5.0 Sop 10 User,Software,1,0,0,N,N,Does not work!,"Norton doesn't work and you will be expected to pay $99 to get Customer Support when the program fails. I am very computer literate and relied on Norton to protect my computer from viruses and malware. I am quite competent at avoiding threats, but there are some that even the most experienced user can't prevent. Their program did not catch an old \\""virus\\"" (technically malware) that has been out for a long time, so it wasn't an unavoidable problem.<br /><br />When I contacted customer support for help removing the program Norton didn't catch, they tried to charge me $99 to correct their mistake before they would even discuss the problem (either do it yourself or pay $99). I spent over 4 hours working with inexperienced techs that did not have adequate computer knowledge trying to get the problem fixed. The \\""Customer Service\\"" agent deleted at least one unrelated program from my computer (was not infected) that I will have to pay to replace. I will now have to spend my time trying to figure out how to totally remove the malware from my computer as it seems to be in the registry and affecting my computer after Norton's software claimed it was quarantined (it took 4 hours and 3 techs to even get that far on top of the multiple scans I had run). I will likely have to pay someone to work on my computer to ensure that my computer is safe and pay for new antivirus software. My computer is nearly unusable.<br /><br />Bottom line, Windows 7 has great antivirus software built in (you do have to find it and turn it on) or you can use a number of free options that work as well or better than Norton. It has been years since I've tried Mcafee so I can't comment on it's effectiveness. Do not depend on Norton even if you are computer literate.

ACT! 2005 [Old Version],Software,2,7,9,N,N,Too many bugs,"My problems began with installation. <br /> <br />1.) File was corrupted upon loading the software from the CD. Went to ACT website, they had the file available (not a unique problem, obviously), and I was then able to load. <br /> <br />2.) I then had problems converting data from ACT! 6.0. Went to ACT website again, only solution was to uninstall and reinstall. I also shut down Spybot, which may have corrupted the first loading. They tell you to shut down Anti-Virus software, which I did, but not Spybot. Data converted after doing this. <br /> <br />3.) I have NO custom fields, but data from my Salutation field did not convert. All fields blank. Since I had converted to ACT! 6.0 from a previous customer manager, this meant I lost all my contact first names, and this was the deal-breaker. I may have been able to get through this, but see 4.). <br /> <br />4.) I did not notice item three for several hours, and used the program during that time. As previous reviewers have noted, it is noticably slower than ACT! 6.0. It also slows down the rest of one's computer, reboot is slower, etc. I also started having problems with MS Outlook crashing, which had never happened before. <br /> <br />All things considered, I decided to return the software, and stick with ACT! 6.0, at least for a year or so while they figure things out. ACT chose to go with a more complex platform, which may help them with their corporate accounts, but is more problematic for smaller users. Computer speed will continue to be an issue. Also, you cannot synch with other users with Windows XP any longer. You must upgrade to Windows Professional. <br /> <br />I found ACT! (Best Software) to be good about trying to make things work, and allowing me to return the software. Their support group surpasses their product development group. If you are dying to try ACT! 2005, either wait a few months while they fix a few things, or be prepared for a tedious conversion process and slowerperformance.

Chess Tactics ART 3.0,Software,3,10,10,N,N,not up to my expectations,"In this review, I consider 3 points<br /><br />1) organization and difficulty of the material<br />2) interface<br />3) software vs book (M. Block \\""The art of combination in chess\\"")<br /><br />1) The soft is marketed to players with elo up to 2300. At the same time, the material is classified according to tactical and geometric motives. This has both pros and cons, and IMHO suits better to beginners and lower itermediates rather than to more advanced intermediates and experts. A book cannot be organized both ways; a software certainly makes it possible, but no such feature (e.g. @show a random position with a difficulty between 50 to 120) exists in CT-ART (even in the test mode, the topic is still shown in the upper bar).<br /><br />The difficulty varies dramatically throughout the course. Comparing with well known Konotop series of tests in chess tactics, difficulty level of 10 should belong to \\""test for beginners\\"" (ca 800-1200 elo), while problems with difficulty above 110 would probably be found in \\""tests for candidate masters\\"" (2000 FIDE Elo and above).<br /><br />2) interface: fair to poor. First of all, if you have windows Vista you need to know a thing or two about the interactions of this soft with your OS. Convecta recommends turning the UCA off, which is plain ridiculous, because ct-art also works fine (if it ever works fine) when you install it in a separate folder outside your \\""program files\\"" folder. Secondly, I never succeeded in making the pieces move faster and the intervals shorter (the pieces move extremely slow. If the problem is easy I nearly fall asleep). Theoretically you can control the speed and the interval, but in practice the soft doesnt respond: thisngs move the same slow way whatever speed you set. If you make a mistake, the program displays a refutation if it typed in. Otherwise, it shows a \\""prompt\\"" using ridiculous blinking markers. I had to quit the excersise and restart it each time I made a mistake. You CAN turn them off though, this option does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART? The very selection of the problems. I do find it excellent, it teaches precision and consideration of all tactical motives in each position. But: here the soft and the book are nearly identical. What is bad in CT-ART? Basically, everything else. Poor interface. ridiculous ratings that have nothing to do with the reality. In many positions there are several ways to win, but the program gives you a penalty (tipically, the first move is unique, but on later stages.... Once I got a penalty for correctly executed checkmate in one!). On the other hand, when solving a difficult problem (90+) I happened to fail to find the principle ideas, but still collect 60% of points for that problem! Conclusion: I quit the soft and got the book.<br /><br />UDP: Now CT-ART is already available with the new Peshk@ interface. As far as I was told, the interface issues have been resolved.<br /><br />Hope this hepls.<br />AVoption does work.<br /><br />3) CT-ART vs Bloch's book. What is good in CT-ART?

Mac OS X Snow Leopard Family Pack (5-User),Software,1,4,16,N,N,Snow Leopard is NOT ready for prime-time. Do NOT upgrade!,"In short: Snow Leopard (SL) feels like a Beta release. It is NOT ready for prime-time. This honestly feels like the release of Microsoft Me (Millenium edition, remember when MS put out that garbage as an \\""upgrade\\"" to '98?). SL is THAT bad. Details: With every update to OS X you hear the stories of third-party apps not being compatible and causing issues. Understandable, given the limitations of some (especially smaller) developers. In my case, the apps in question are Apple's own Mail and iTunes. Specifically, Mail would lock while trying to download new mail. The update circle/arrow next to each email address would spin all day. Meanwhile, the same mail came through just fine on my wife's MacBook Pro (running 10.5.8). iTunes would at some point (while sitting idle all day while I'm off at work) inform me that my iTunes library could not be found and the pop-up error messages (one for each of the thousands of items in my iTunes library) could not be Force Quit. After rebooting, everything would work fine for a while. This is why I switched to a Mac. To avoid this exact issue (rebooting multiple times a day just to do the basics). I upgraded my iMac (just over a year old, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4) to SL on 9/3 and gave it a week to sort out any issues. Last night I threw in the towel and reverted back to Leopard (this is why you MUST create a cloned copy of your hard drive before you upgrade (use Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner and create a bootable drive (and test it! (hold down the Option key while you reboot)) before you do any OS upgrade (PC or Mac))). Time Machine couldn't save me. It told me I was out of disk space (I wasn't). I know all the great features Apple put into SL (which I why I upgraded so early in the life-cycle) and was loving them (smart disk eject, click and hold on an app in the Dock and see all the occurences of that app, super fast boot times, etc). But until the bugs get fixed, I don't dare go near Microsoft Me - sorry,I meant Snow Leopard - again. Apple, shame on you for putting out this garbage as a gold master. You were a month ahead of schedule and still rushed the QA. And it shows. No longer will I be able to say \\""get a Mac, it just works\\"". I've put many friends into Macs over the years. Now I just can't recommend them without a huge caveat. Not until Apple makes this right. Well, Apple... we're waiting....",9/10/2009,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

"Fluenz French 1+2+3+4+5 for Mac, PC, iPhone, iPad & Android Phones, Version 3",Software,5,1,1,N,Y,excellent language learning tool,"I have a general working knowledge of several languages - studied in high school and college and through living and working in various countries - but have never formally studied French and knew very little of it. I've been looking for years for a suitable program for it but have always shied away from the \\""total immersion\\"" approach of Rosetta Stone. From my, albeit limited, exposure to Rosetta, it seems that their lessons leave too many unsolved questions about what's going on. To follow them, you'd really need to equip yourself with a grammar book and dictionary and be prepared to dig for lots of explanations the lessons don't supply.<br /><br />The theory behind an immersion program seems to be that little children learn languages much better than adults, so we should try to mimic that experience with adults. The trouble is that adults don't learn as little children do - and as the Fluenz creators recognize, that's both a plus and a minus. It's a disadvantage in that adults will most likely never master a language quite as deeply as a child. An English-speaking adult who learns French, for example,will never be able to speak French without at least a trace of an English accent. But having learned English thoroughly before learning French is also a huge advantage! English speaking adults can leverage their existing knowledge of how a language (English) works to learn the target language. As adult English speakers, we already understand the many forms we need a verb to take: for I, you, s/he, we, they. So when we learn the \\""I\\"" form, we look for the \\""he\\"" form and etc. Because of the knowledge we have of what we don't know, we make much more rapid progress in the target language than a child could.<br /><br />But. We can do so only if we are given explanations that correspond to the questions we naturally have. For a simple example: we naturally wonder, why do you say you are going \\""en France\\"" but \\""a Paris\\""? It's unnecessarily frustrating if the language program youuse never bothers to provide you with the simple explanation that you always use \\""a\\"" when you are going to a city but not necessarily to a country.<br /><br />Each Fluenz lesson begins with a short intro, then goes to a dialogue which provides information and vocabulary relevant to tourists. Each lesson develops and expands upon the grammar introduced in the previous lessons. Because most people traveling to Francophone countries will be interested in getting the basics down, lessons often center on being in a cafe and ordering food, or with traveling from place to place or asking questions at a hotel. These short dialogues can be listened to with no subtitles, with subtitles only in French, and with subtitles in English and French. After the student has listened to the dialogue, the instructor comes on and goes through what the student has just heard, line by line, adding additional relevant information as well as mnemonic devices to help students retain the information. The instructor also adds related concepts or structures to those introduced in the dialogue. Subsequent \\""workouts\\"" encourage students to practice through reading, writing, listening and speaking. What I find particularly delightful are the little comments the instructor sprinkles in along the way about some element from film or sports or culture. Once, the instructor mentioned that the bidet was \\""one of France's great gifts to womankind.\\"" I doubt I'll ever forget that line as it was so unexpected and human a remark.<br /><br />As much as I love this program, I would have given it 4.75 stars rather than 5 if that were possible because the software is just a bit glitchy. You have to play around with it in order to get it to work properly. For example, you might, in a given workout, get just one question and find, when you hit \\""next\\"" that the workout seems to be done. There is no way to move forward within it. What you need to do in that case is select \\""next workout\\"" and then go back - and backwards -until you complete the previous workout. It took a while for me to realize this, so I missed some valuable practice along the way.<br /><br />Overall, Fluenz is an excellent program, long overdue. I look forward to learning my next language with Fluenz.",6/13/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The Invincible Iron Man: The Complete Collection,Software,5,2,2,N,Y,Amazing value at the original price,"This collection consists of actual comic books that have been individually scanned and converted to PDF files. This is one of a number of such collections, all of which were an absolutely amazing value when they were first published, with hundreds of comic books, some dating back to the 1960s, available on a single DVD for one low price. Unfortunately, Marvel Comics refused to continue licensing their content to Git Corp and the collections are no longer available. Today, the DVDs are collector's items, sometimes going for hundreds of dollars. At their original publishing price, this was an incredible deal. At the prices today, when you can even find them, you should definitely think twice.<br /><br />The files are not DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected, so you can copy the PDF files to your computer or laptop, even to your Kindle Fire tablet. You can also create backup DVDs to make sure that your collection always remains accessible. If you view the collections on your computer or laptop, using the Adobe official PDF viewer, everything is fine. If you view the collections on your Kindle Fire tablet, there is a semi-transparent &#34;Marvel&#34; watermark that will show up on every page. I've tried every PDF viewer in the Amazon App Store, including the Adobe PDF app, and they all exhibit this flaw. Once I got used to it, though, it didn't bother me much and it's handy to have a really portable way to read these files.<br /><br />Each file contains one complete comic book, including the front and back covers, all of the advertisements, the letters page, and so on. The files are arranged in two-page spreads, 1100 pixels wide by 850 pixels high. I can reduce these to roughly 75% of full size and still read them. Much below that and the text becomes hard to read and the details are muddy.<br /><br />For the collections that go back to the 60s and 70s, it's both nostalgic and hilarious to read some of the advertisements (Sea Monkeys! X-Ray Specs! Charles Atlas!). The scan quality in those earlier issues is surprisingly good, considering the age of each comic book. These are very readable, in very good condition.<br /><br />This collection begins in 1963 with Tales of Suspense #39 (for 12 cents!) where Iron Man was first introduced. In 1964, in Tales of Suspense #59, Captain America joined Iron Man and the comic title officially became Tales of Suspense featuring Iron Man and Captain America. This continued until 1968, where issue #99 became the final Tales of Suspense issue and each hero subsequently got his own title. The Iron Man title continued through issue 332, in 1996, after which Marvel rebooted the character and restarted the issue numbering. The reboot concluded in 1997 with issue #13, with a second reboot beginning in 1998 and ending in 2004 with issue #89. There was a third reboot in 2005 and the collection concludes with issue #12 of that reboot, in 2006. In addition, the collection contains Annuals 1 through 15, Annuals 1998 through 2001, Giant-Size Iron Man #1 (from 1975), and a detailed Iron Man bio.

The reboot concluded in 1997 with issue #13, with a second reboot beginning in 1998 and ending in 2004 with issue #89. There was a third reboot in 2005 and the collection concludes with issue #12 of that reboot, in 2006. In addition, the collection contains Annuals 1 through 15, Annuals 1998 through 2001, Giant-Size Iron Man #1 (from 1975), and a detailed Iron Man bio.

The work around was to call tech support and get files from them to complete a multi-step process that took 3 days. Once all that was done I did get it to run and have only done simple things like change pitch and tempo.

TurboTax Basic 2003,Software,5,5,5,N,N,Turbo leads the pack!,"I was hesitant to buy Turbo this year after having left to buy TaxCut last year when Intuit had the arrogance to put spyware into their product and add a disturbing activation process. I had always been a Turbo user but was so incensed at last years shenanigans by Intuit that I switched to TaxCut (and would do so again, should they initiate the same nonsense as they did in 2002). In any case, TaxCut in not even remotely as user friendly or robust as Turbo and given the opportunity to have Turbo as it was in 2001 and prior I have gladly come back. After reading the reviews on Amazon I hesitated, but am glad I gave it a try. The installation (on a Win 98 machine)was flawless (except for a minor glitch of it crashing my system when updating the software the first time). Useability is as good as always, in my opinion, which as I've said is light years ahead of TaxCut. In light of the options available on the market, Turbo is the clear choice (unless you want to suffer with a lesser product like TaxCut -- which I will grudgingly do again if Intuit plays games like they did in 2002!)",3/14/2004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack (3-User) [Old Version],Software,5,0,0,N,N,Windows 7 Home Premium 3 Pack,"Great price on an awesome OS. When installing on your second and 3rd PC make sure to answer and you call the MS helpline make sure to answer no to installed on multiple PC's and talk to the MS rep, let them know your using the family pack and you should be good to go. I cant say enough good things about Windows 7. Using it on 3 PC's, networking and security is a breeze using home group and related permissions. Can use media center for free OTA DVR recording, and share out recorded TV and family videos for the whole house. I have done a ton of Win7 Installs for friends and family and the great majority of hardware is detected right off the bat. Occasionally you may need to tweak a setting but by far this is the best MS OS to date. Its fun to use and easy to manage and works with alot of software. Pro edition adds Domain logons and XP mode, however most shouldnt need these features and can still use MS Virtual PC or VMware for similar functionality. Media Center is fun to tweak, if you do this with a 15 IR remote you can use your PC isntead of Tivio or other similar PVR/DVR solutions. For most this will save 60-80$ a month on TV costs and when coupled with netflix and Hulu offers up some great programming. We get 60 stations in my city over the air which is more than enough. My kids havent complained one bit and have many new programs they love to watch on PBS and Qubo.<br /><br />Detection of network devices and hardware is a snap. Any Dual core 2Ghz plus machine with 2GB ram runs great, but for the record I have even tested on a 5yr old Latitude D610 with 1.5GB ram and even that system runs fine. Bottom line is this OS is simple enough for a novice and loaded with features for anyone who wants to take advantage of them. Drives a little closer to a Mac but with tons more software applications and flexability. I love runing virtual PC sessions for work and fun and how well it all integrated between Win7 PC's.",11/29/2010,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2008 - 3 User Pack,Software,2,0,0,N,Y,"It had bugs, but they have been fixed","Well, I have had this software installed on an old Dell Windows 2000 machine and on a new home-built Win XP machine based on an Intel motherboard for less than a year. I can not say that I have been too happy with the overall performance of this product, but it seems to be working well now that it has the latest patches. By the way, they don't tell you that their version 8 and higher software does not work with Windows 2000. So if you want to run an old Win 2K matchine, don't go for this software unless you can get the last of the Version 7 software - version 7.0.483.000. I had the same negative experiences that the above reviewers had, but again, they are now corrected. My XP machine does run the latest version 8 software and it seems to be working great. My Win 2K machine has to run version 7.0.483.000. and it does OK. Can't really complain about the Win2K machine as it is so slow anyway and is no longer supported by Microsoft anyway. Regarding the reviewers that gave this software a 5 star rating. I find it hard to believe that these are legitimate reviews. I would actually suspect these reviews as being sales pitches from the Zone Alarm folks. I find that this company is a little questionable in how they deal with their customers and their customer service. I have seen them delete negative comments on their software from their user forums. They have never lied (that I am aware of), but I simply felt that they do their best to put a rosey picture on their product. As one reviewer above noted, their Tech Support put the blame on my other programs when ZA practically brought my XP machine to its knees. I also was told to disable my other programs until I found \\""the culprit\\"". Well I didn't do that. I have those programs on my computer because I want them there. Better that ZA should fix their product, which they eventually did. However, they never simply came out and took the blame for a defective product update. I used to love their freefirewall and this was why I decided to try their full service product. Hopefully these bad experiences were just growing pains that ZA is getting past, but they have damaged their reputation by failing to be completely forthcoming with their customers.

MacSpeech Dictate [Old Version],Software,3,3,5,N,Y,pretty frustrating,"I bought this software for transcribing handwritten documents and interviews (I listened to the interviews and repeated the words into the microphone). Unfortunately, it was almost always faster for me to type because the program makes a LOT of mistakes. My interviews and documents have tons of proper names and uncommon older words in them though, so I think MacSpeech might work better for other kinds of dictations or transcriptions. I also find this program to be extremely buggy. It usually crashes at least once per day, even after I installed the updated version. I used MacSpeech quite a bit because my wrists were getting strain injuries from typing, but I usually just ended up getting really frustrated. Maybe with a lot of effort, I could train MacSpeech to better recognize my voice, but I'm not willing to invest more time than it would take me just to type the transcription in the first place.

Intuit Quicken Deluxe 2009,Software,3,8,8,N,N,Installation Problem; Customer Support Limited,"I have used Intuit's Quicken for many years and have considered Intuit to be one of the best software companies around. However, I was not completely satisfied with my Quicken Deluxe 2009 experience. First of all, since 2007, Quicken has not had a Basic Edition for around $30. I don't need a Deluxe Edition for around $50. That is why I didn't upgrade in 2008, but had no choice in 2009 if I was going to upgrade at all. When I installed Quicken 2009, the program would not run. The Quicken logo flashed on the screen and disappeared. I restarted and reinstalled Quicken. I had the same problem, so I checked what support options I had, as I had never had to contact Intuit support before. I was disappointed, to say the least, that Intuit does not offer free telephone support, but warns of a $25.00 fee. Moreover, Intuit calls you back; you cannot call in directly to get a support agent. So I had to settle for Chat support. I did get the problem resolved, but it took thirty minutes, whereas it would have taken about ten minutes if I had been able to talk to a live person on the phone. It turned out that I did not have the right mapi32.dll. The Chat support agent did pick up this problem pretty quickly, and once the new DLL was installed, Quicken worked. The mapi32.dll problem may not have been Quicken's fault, but I first spent five minutes trying to find troubleshooting help on the Intuit web site, and this solution never came up. I had previously thought that Intuit's help information was the best in the industry. My opinion of Intuit has moderated from 5 stars to 3 stars. Quicken is still probably the best such program around, but 2009 may not be as trouble free as it has been for me over the last ten-plus years.",2/13/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
SMARTSUITE MIL ED 9.8.2,Software,4,1,1,N,N,A great suite of programs - I LOVE that I can use Organizer again!!!!!,"About six months ago, my trusty XP computer that I had used for many years quit working. I knew I didn't want to move to Windows 8 with all the complaints about it not running half the programs I have come to love over the years, so I bought one with Windows 7. I was able to load most of my older and well-liked programs, but was VERY sad that one of my favorite programs of all time wouldn't load - Lotus Organizer. It is, by far, the best program of it's kind ever made!!! I loaded it on my laptop running Vista just so I wouldn't lose all of my contacts or my Christmas Card list, and quit using the daily calendar and to-do functions all together, and started using the crappy alternative in Office. Well, I'm happy to report that I found a version of Organizer that works perfectly in Windows 7 in this suite of programs, and I couldn't be happier!<br /><br />There are a couple of things I wanted to mention for those who have been trying to do the same thing. First, this entire suite loaded on my Acer running 64 bit Windows 7 flawlessly. Word Pro is almost the same as I remember AmiPro from years ago, and Lotus 1-2-3 is SO much better than Excel. However, if you try to upgrade (convert) your .or2 file from Lotus Organizer release 2 like I did, you'll be disappointed that it won't convert, even if you compact it first. I'm not sure why this version 5 won't convert it because it says it should. But, don't give up like I almost did. The way I worked around this was to export the contacts, anniversaries and any other categories in the older version of Organizer as either ansi or ascii text files and then imported them into the respective categories in this newer version. Every file came through flawlessly doing it that way. After a number of months missing my trusty old Organizer, it's back - and just as good as ever!!!",5/25/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Norton Internet Security 2005 - Single User,Software,1,0,1,N,N,NIS - has the most features - but NO backup!!! - and a UI from Hell,"(this review is of the Spyware edition) <br />NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have &lt;256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO) <br /> <br />NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT <br />half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work. <br /> <br />Even after LiveUpdate this week, <br />One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. <br />I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. <br />Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. <br />It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! <br />The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining \\""permitted once\\"" 200 times, no actual info <br /> until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE \\""permitted once\\"" IIRC. <br /> <br />NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either. <br /> <br />Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet. <br />Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated. <br />Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented. <br /> <br />If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either \\""permit all\\"" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no \\""permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80\\"" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick \\""web browser\\"" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category. <br /> <br />After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much. <br /> <br />All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. <br />Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig. <br /> <br />I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price. <br />",5/31/2006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PHP With MYSQL Essential Training,Software,5,1,2,N,N,Excellent way to learn dynamic web development,"Could you imagine being able to write a site like Amazon.com from scratch? Well if you master everything in this title you will have the basic knowledge toward that end. Even though he creates a real contact management system, the theory is similar and you can continue from there. I taught Math and Computer Science professionally, and I bought this tutorial to learn the specifics of putting together a dynamic website using PHP (I'm a Java, VB, SQL, and C/C++ programmer). I may be a bit biased with my background, but this guy is a top notch instructor and speaker. I sat thru the entire course, even though what I was really interested in was the very practical website he sets up at the end. Many of the concepts in php are built on C and Java. Although its not a language that would win any awards from the Computer Science community (extremely loose typing for example), it is EXTREMELY powerful and will make writing web applications faster and easier. The array and string processing functions are nothing short of remarkable, and make it SO much easier for a new programmer to write effective programs. One line of code turns a delimited string into an array, or vice versa. Sure you can do many of those things in C++, but you would have to be an expert programmer. PHP is wonderful. There is also considerable background on SQL/databases. This title is well worth the money, this course in a private college would be well over a grand. He takes you from installing the necessary software to finalizing a website that can be developed into something much larger. If you have even the slightest background in programming you should be fine. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could, because it may require some extra effort for the absolute beginner. If your computer experience consists of web surfing and MS office, depending on your aptitudes you may find it a bit difficult, the same way some people find foreign language or music difficult. Others can start speaking Chinese from a web tutorial. Again it depends on you. I would strongly suggest a pre-requsite of Basic HTML and CSS from free sites such as w3schools (google for others), maybe even a programming tutorial from there. However, the title is very good because many \\""easier\\"" tutorials will leave you feeling dry at the end and you won't really have anything to show for it. With my experience in teaching programming languages to newbies, you may have to devote many hours, pause the video and do some googling to solidify these concepts. Becoming a great programmer needs time, patience, and dedication. Do not expect to simply watch the videos and become and expert. Bring a notebook and take notes, type each example into the text editor. Sometimes he will ask you to complete something that he started, and I would be a bit intimidated if I were totally new to programming. I suggest going through those exercises two or even three times until you completely understand it. Again, consider spending a few hours a day for a month to master this material if you are COMPLETELY new to programming. A professional programmer may pick up php fluency in less than a week. This video would be great in a corporate setting to cross train front end web personnel into programming if they are working on a project. Also, considering how web-centric the world is today, even management and non-technical types would benefit from the intimate understanding of what goes into a dynamic-data driven website(he gets into business analysis of the programming situation). Even if you aren't going to do the programming, understanding this title can help you leverage other resources and help you get the best result. Mr. Skoglund also has an advanced PHP video published[...], I will probably be purchasing that too in the near future. http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-Beyond-Basics-Kevin-Skoglund/dp/1596715413/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253132473&sr=1-3",9/16/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Microsoft Windows Small Business Server Standard 2003 (5 Client) [Old Version],Software,4,27,31,N,N,Server Basics 101,"I just took on setting up my first small office network. We have four computers and a desktop that someone set up to run as a server. The 6 gig harddrive had long seen its time and needed to be replaced. I bought a Dell PowerEdge SC420, 4 Windows XP Professional upgrades (from Amazon at an amazing price and current rebate) and Windows Small Business Server 2003 (also at a great price). I've worked on PC's for years but never set up a office network with a server.

The Witcher Limited Edition (Large Box),Software,5,7,7,N,N,GAMING AS IT SHOULD BE!,"Were I a member of the gaming Industry right now, I would be shamed to be taught what gaming should look and feel like and how it should be marketed by a small Eastern European company. Who of the multi-billion gaming \\""giants\\"" ever went back to improve a released game? Yet, there you have it: thanks to CDPROJECT gaming as an art-form is still alive and kicking!<br /><br />This was the most awaited fantasy cRPG in the past 3 years. Not only did the original deliver, but even more work has gone into truly improving it.<br />THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAD EVER PLAYED - AND NOW IT IS GORGEOUS!<br /><br />The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in both FABLE and TITAN QUEST as well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!<br /><br />The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.<br /><br />Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.<br />Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to PLANESCAPE. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.<br />Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the DIABLO or the TITAN QUEST abilities systems.<br /><br />So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the atrocious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.<br />Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.<br /><br />Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...<br /><br />Whereas the BALDUR's GATES saga was story-heavy but (by today standards) visually wanting and the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS series was found, well, wanting in all aspects, THE WITCHER is the dream cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - and its current EA bedfellows surely put a stop to such aspirations now. That game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect.<br />A tip of my hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!y hat to CDPROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of Gaming alive. Well done indeed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7/27/2009,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac,Software,5,0,0,N,N,Have the Best of Both Worlds,"I switched to Mac over 7 years ago. Many business programs, such as Quickbooks and tax software run on a Windows platform. The Mac version of Quickbooks is a shadow of the Windows version. Other programs such as Corel Draw are also Windows based.<br /><br />Rather than switching between Boot Camp or having a separate PC for these programs, Parallels makes it possible to run the business and graphics software from the same machine and very conveniently. It's only a click of a window to switch between operating systems and programs. The more RAM you have, the better everything works. I can have many programs open simultaneously and switch back and forth easily.<br /><br />I can print from Windows, through Parallels with the Mac printers. Parallels will recognize the printers, even when their IP addresses change after a restart. Very convenient.<br /><br />Mac offers a much more stable operating system than Windows.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 11 [Old Version],Software,2,22,23,N,N,An overrated program with a lot of potential but a lot of rough edges too,"Pros:<br /><br />1) capable of decent accuracy with modest training, and very good accuracy with more extended training<br />2) can keep up with relatively fast speaking meaning overall excellent speed of text generation<br />3) capacity to train multiple users and work within multiple dialects<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) unreliable, crash prone, and buggy - this program needs major work<br />2) poorly sorted out Windows 7 correction dialog operations (ultra-slow)<br />3) program becomes unstable when microphone is turned off for protracted periods of time, requiring reinitialization and reloading.<br />4) program support is a joke - Nuance has to be the most arrogant software company in the world despite some hard working staffers (yup - worse than Microsoft!)<br /><br />It's almost impossible to be on the Internet or working with the computer and not be aware of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking 11.0. You would think from the relentless advertisement by Nuance that the program never makes a mistake, and allows seamless control of your computer while allowing you to dictate virtually everything. Unfortunately, the hype and promise fall well short of the program's actual functioning.<br /><br />Although quite good accuracy is possible with modest levels of training, and very good accuracy is possible in technical fields with training of technical vocabulary, the program's buggy operation, recurrent vulnerability to crashing, humongous speech files and subsequent painfully slow loading, and very slow correction interface (much lower for some reason on Windows 7 than on Windows XP) spoil an otherwise enjoyable experience badly.<br /><br />Although I am almost totally dependent on the program for professional writing (cranking out roughly 20 single spaced pages a day in a scientific area), I am continually amazed with how many rough edges the program has that Nuance seems to be oblivious to, because they recur from edition to edition. As but a small example of lack of attention to relevant details, the program within Microsoft Word does not use the specialized characters for quotation marks, but uses a generic and plainer character set, instead of the one generated within Microsoft Word. This means that if you want professional looking final product, you have to run a macro to replace their generic quotation marks with the proper special character. Although this is a small issue, it's just an example of so many ways in which the program falls down, and displays its lack of polish. It is amazing that despite five editions of the product which I have used that this issue continues, despite feedback from multiple users.<br /><br />Then there is the issue of loading and speed of operation. With a solid-state drive that gets to the Windows 7 desktop in 20 seconds, it takes 25 seconds to load speech files on NaturallySpeaking 11.0. In other words, an extremely fast hard drive loads a bloated operating system faster than it loads NaturallySpeaking 11.0. I hesitate to think how long it would take somebody to load speech files on the average 250 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. You could go out, mow your lawn, calculate your taxes, then do your email, and come back just in time to start dictating.<br /><br />Well, so what? Once the program is loaded, things should be okay, right? Well this is where again the program falls down. First of all, actually correcting things reveals a major bug in their Windows 7 code around keyboard input within the corrections dialog box. When you bring up the correction dialog box, you can't type characters without generating a long delay before the program somehow incorporates your keyboard input (roughly 10-12 seconds) - this is unacceptable waiting time for entering a couple of characters. Dictating or spelling out words within the correction dialog box produces somewhat snappier results, but is still amazingly slow, (again running this program on an extremely fast processor, with 6 GB of RAM, and one of the fastest 250 GB solid-state drives). It's scary to imagine how slow this program would be on the average system. In fairness, some of it appears to be a Windows 7 incompatibility, because I use the same speech files and the same 11.0 version on a Windows XP system, and had much snappier response from within the corrections dialog box. Of course Nuance advertises that their code is Windows 7 compatible - something got lost in the translation. But again, this suggests that Nuance is more concerned with their advertising than with the program's actual performance. This is a continuing theme - Nuance's grandiosity gets continually in the way of their ability to see any problems with the program (or their support - which is clearly an industry low-water mark).<br /><br />The biggest problem though is what happens when you put the program (at least 11.0 - corrected in 11.5) into Suspend by turning off the microphone- and by the way, you are forced to do this because if you simply tell the program to \\""go to sleep\\"" any sound into the microphone will cause the page to scroll back to where the cursor is (in other words any kind of sound acts as a reinitialization command to the cursor - the logic behind that completely escapes me! So essentially you are forced to suspend microphone input if you want to scroll through your text instead of the program intrusively interfering with this. This is where things get really interesting (after you turn the microphone off). After about 5 min., the program will malfunction (again only in Windows 7 and not in Windows XP for some strange reason) and give you an error code which the program cannot recover from, and thus all this nonsense requires that you basically start from scratch all over again. This means not simply reloading the program, because the program actually doesn't pull itself out of memory reliably and oftentimes leaves a huge executable sitting in the background (taking up over 300 MB of RAM) - - if you don't kill the program this way, when you try to reinitialize it, you will immediately get the same error code. This means you have to bring up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files. This will again take a long period of time - close to 30 seconds with a solid-state drive, A minute and a half with a slow conventional hard drive. All of this nonsense of course significantly deteriorates the productivity advantage associated with dictating versus typing. Indeed, for short pieces of text, all these hassles mean that it is almost always faster to simply type out a couple of paragraphs then it is to struggle with the program. For longer text generation, and assuming that you dictate continuously and don't risk putting the microphone into the off position for any extended period, the program is more productive and faster than typing.<br /><br />This process of recurrent shutdown and reinitializing (due to fatal program errors) can be very frustrating, and oftentimes has to be repeated multiple times, because if you leave the program on (by not turning off the microphone), and there is any background noise you'll get endless junk words into your dictation space. This brings up another striking failure of the program - its total inability to discriminate speech from background sounds and non-speech noises. The program seems to believe that every conceivable sound must translate into a word, and therefore, any kind of background noise makes it impossible to use the program particularly if you are not using a noise canceling microphone, and instead are dictating on a laptop that has a standard integrated microphone. You would think that the program, which runs on an enormous number of laptops, would be optimized for the standard integrated microphones on laptops. Unfortunately, it is not. You have to use Dragon's headphone microphone gear or some equivalent. Curiously, a much earlier version of the program NaturallySpeaking 8.0seem to work much better with laptop microphone arrays. Why this might be is beyond me.<br /><br />Because the program code is buggy and unreliable and subsequently the program locks up, you will find that occasionally your speech files are completely trashed and cannot be repaired through Nuance's repair algorithms (there is a speech file Restore function from within the program). This means you had better make a backup copy of your speech files (make that several backup copies), or you will find yourself having to retrain your user identity all over again, from scratch. Additionally, you will find that their optimization program (which gives you the chance to optimize speech files that have had numerous corrections made to them) is not reliable and also locks up regularly. And BTW, its continual crashing will occasionally damage programs with which it is linked, such as Word and Outlook, requiring re-installation of those as well. In other words, this program does not play nice with your system.<br /><br />In case you're suspicious that these difficulties are unique to my machine, or are a function of viruses, spyware, or other hardware problems, rest assured that none of these issues are remotely responsible for the Programs buggy and unreliable operation. I run two spyware and antivirus programs concurrently, my system is about as fast as a window 7 system can be (Windows experience index 6.7 overall), and I always keep the machine in good working order. Just to clarify, I do tech support for most of my friends on their Windows 7 and Windows XP systems - so the problem isn't that I have a damaged Windows installation that is to blame for these issues.<br /><br />All of these operational headaches spoil what otherwise might be a useful program. I believe that all of this emerges from Nuance having a very grandiose notion about their software, and not really listening very much to end-users. It's a shame that there is no real competition in the PC marketplace when it comes to dictation software. If there was, I suspect Nuance would have to get their act together because they would quickly lose market share. Given all these issues, 2/5 stars is actually generous. I wish I could make do without the program, or transition to another speech recognition platform, but unfortunately I can't.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forget the best part: don't expect Nuance to know anything about any of these issues. They have some of the worst technical support I have ever seen in the industry. They blame your system and your computer and claim there are no deficiencies in their program(!).<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Dragon 11.5 has just been released and after several weeks - I can see that Nuance has fixed some things, but not touched many others. It no longer crashes as frequently, or generates bizarre error codes as frequently, requiring that it has to be re-initialized regularly - although that still happens. It loads somewhat more quickly. However, it continues to interpret every sound as speech, has a painfully slow corrections dialog, and as per the norm, reaching technical support is like trying to call the Dept. of Defense and you don't have technical support past 90 days. It is painfully obvious that Nuance has no real handle on the program's deficiencies, and therefore it is a 2/5 star program. I can't recommend it.up Task manager, find the program, and manually terminate it, and then start from scratch and reload your speech files.

After 20 min I was able to reboot my newly recovered drive. <br />The only issue I had is that I use a new motherboard that includes the Intel 1000/100BaseT network chip-set, and the PowerQuest recovery disk did not recognize it, so would've not been able to do a restore by using a network stored image. However this should not be a issue since in the online manual there is information on how to load drivers at boot time, I haven't used the procedure for now.<br />On more thing, this product is extremlly easy to use. All functions, including the recovery disk use the WindowsXP intreface, not DOS.",9/24/2003,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alsoft DiskWarrior 4.0 for Intel & PowerPC Macs,Software,5,1,1,N,N,succeeds when Mac's Disk Utility fails,"I have used each version of this product for close to 10 years now to recover files that would otherwise be lost. Most recently, Mac 10.8 Disk Utility could not repair my system drive after it failed to boot. It even indicated that the disk had to be reformatted (erased). So I booted from an external hard drive loaded with the Mac OS and ran Disk Warrior from there. DW also indicated that it could not replace my directory with the one it had rebuilt. However (this is where the magic happens) the Preview feature was able to mount (make visible) my iMac's internal drive even though Mac Disk Utility couldn't.<br /><br />From there, I could copy my entire user directory from the iMac over to the external drive, erase the corrupted iMac drive, and start fresh with a new OS. Now I just have to copy my home directory back. I prefer running DW from an external drive because any DVD boot disc such as DW is going to be painfully slow. I recovered 15 GB of data in less than an hour with the external drive.

Quicken Deluxe 20,Software,1,1,1,N,Y,"Goodbye to Quicken, long time user has jumped ship","I am a long time user of Quicken who has decided to jump ship. I am very frustrated with this once-loved program and the level of non-support they currently provide. I AM DONE. Here is my story:<br /><br />FEB 2, 2015:<br />Quicken has abolished phone support! I just spent over an hour trying to CHAT my way to resolution on a very basic problem that is inexplicably gob-smacking for them. Here is what happened: My bank changed their log in system and made me select a new username and password. Once I did that, I attempted to update Quicken, but now it won't connect to that bank. Something in the Quicken software doesn't like the change and though I can log in to the bank through a web browser just fine, in Quicken it won't work. Now I have to wait 3-5 days for some advanced department to review my log files and get back to me. Something like this happened last year and back then they fixed in in an hour while I talked to them on the phone. Not having phone support sucks!<br /><br />FEB 2, 2015: Email from Quicken.

Please respond back with a resolution.<br /><br />FEB 13, 2015:<br />I initiated a new chat session to ask for an update. First I was told that work on my issue had halted because I had deactivated my account and that they were waiting for me to reactivate it. This is complete rubbish!

The Elements picture editing software is great and it will challenge me with features yet to be understood for some time. While I have just started using the Premiere video editing software, it seems to be great too.

Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2013 3-Users [Old Version],Software,2,0,2,N,N,Not the best. Created problems.,"Decided to give the software a try. Bundled in with a computer purchase. Machine is a middle-shelf 64 bit Windows 8 laptop from a big box outlet. (Purchased specifically for low level college lab work.) Saw all low threat research related web browsing (absolutely no social media, porn, gaming etc). Attributed poor computer performance out of the box to hardware shortcomings.<br /> Upon expiration of the six month Trend Micro license the software was replaced and a complete scan was performed with a new product. Numerous malware found by the new product that had been missed by Trend Micro Titanium.<br /> In fairness, the software was not able to scan the laptop that frequently. It was rarely left on when not in use. It may have performed 6-8 full system scans during the period.<br /> More significant, I noticed that the Trend Micro add in for the two different web browsers I tried to use created instabilities when accessing content on my college websites. The browser would \\""lock up\\"" or the homework site would freeze/time out. Flash videos and other media objects were not always accessible. Again, I attributed this to a discount laptop purchase.

Norton Ghost 14.0 [OLD VERSION],Software,4,3,5,N,Y,Another solid product from Symantec.,"The only reason I gave Ghost 14 four stars is because during the backup screens you do not see all the partitions on your hard drive in the default configuration. A novice user would not know that other hidden partitions exist on their computer and would probably not backup them. If the purpose of Ghost 14 is to backup an entire computer then the user should see all partitions that exist on their hard disks as the default configuration. Let the user hide any partition as an option since I know hidden partitions are important too. If your hard disk fails you do want everything back including the hidden partitions. In my opinion the menu configurations of Ghost 14 are more complicated than what it needs to be for the average user. Gone are the days of Ghost 2003 when Symantec would allow a home user to backup all his computers at home with a single copy of Ghost. Now we must all purchase one license of Ghost per PC. The only Reason I purchased Ghost 14 was because DELL messed up their bios on my new laptop so Ghost 2003 would not work with their USB ports. Ghost 2003 would allow you to create your own boot CD disks if you knew how to create boot CD disks with Nero and knew how to modify batch files. You were able to boot Ghost from a CD and backup your entire computer to an external/internal drive or burn a CD or DVD backup. Ghost 2003 is still able to backup all my other computers with Windows Vista and Windows XP (32bit and 64bit versions). The Ghost 14 bootable CD only restores images and does not have any backup software available so it behaves like a rescue CD. All backups in Ghosts 14 are conveniently done when logged in to a Windows XP or Windows Vista account unlike Ghost 2003 which requires you to use a bootable CD, USB Drive, or floppy disks.",10/12/2008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac [OLD VERSION],Software,5,0,0,N,N,"Paralles 4.0 over Fusion, Virtual Box, and Crossover","First off, I am here to testify that Parallels 4.0 is the best solution to running Windows apps on Mac OS X. I have tried Crossover (Crossover Games too), VMWare Fusion 2.0, and Sun's Virtual Box. Crossover([...]) is a good solution if you just want to run one windows app but anymore and it becomes a really big headache (if are not a computer engineer/programer). Virtual Box ([...]) is great if you like free stuff but again same thing with Crossover, if you are not a computer engineer/programmer it's a very difficult application. VMWare Fusion 2.0 (http://www.amazon.com/Smith-Micro-Software-Inc-VMFM20BX2/dp/B001F5VBRU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=software&qid=1252022776&sr=8-1)is great to run Windows apps but can be slow at times. I first bought Fusion about a month ago. I have been reviewing all of these products since I bought my Macbook Air, yes I said Air, in January 2009: these are my results. I tried VMWare first because at that time it had the best reviews. These are the operating systems I have used on VMWare Fusion 2.0 and Virtual Box: Linux Ubuntu 9.04, Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate (32-bit RC), and Sun Open Solaris 10. VMWare doesn't work with Open Solaris very well (I haven't tried Open Solaris with Paralles yet), in Virtual Box Open Solaris worked pretty good. I say this up front Windows XP works great with all three virtual machines, not a problem. Windows 7 does not work in Virtual Box, period but works in VMWare Fusion 2.0 very slow. Windows 7 runs great under Paralles. Crossover doesn't even support anything past Windows XP. Ubuntu 9.04 worked pretty well with VMWare Fusion and Virtual Box (again, haven't tried Paralles yet). The biggest issue I found with Virtual Box is the fact that wireless internet is not useable in the guest machine nor does shared folders work at all (on any of the OS's). The biggest issue with VMWare Fusion is friendliness, Paralles just looks much better and again just works without issues. Overall, I rate this product to be the best of the best virtual machines out there to date. NOTE: IF YOU WANT A PRODUCT THAT JUST WORKS GO WITH PARALLES 4.0.

Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer Suite 7.0 [OLD VERSION],Software,3,109,115,N,Y,Know What the Program is NOT Before You Buy,"I think this can be a fun suite of programs if you like to speculate about how a new project in your house or yard might turn out. A reasonable library of materials and a relatively simple design process allow you to create rough approximations. <br /> <br />There are software limitations, however, that will frustrate perfectionists. Design angles are limited to 7.5 degree increments, for instance, so getting the exact angle of your hedge, angled sidewalk, or slanted driveway may not be possible if that angle isn't divisible by 7.5 degrees. <br /> <br />Another example of limitations is that the roofing application makes no provision for certain circumstances in which two sections of roof have different slopes. The result is that you can't really recreate the roof on an L-shaped house unless the two branches of the L are the same width. I thought this was a user error until I found that the tech support solution was to widen the thinner section of the house to get the roof to line up right. <br /> <br />In short, the program is not going to provide architectural specs for a house or a reliable blueprint for landscaping your yard. Perfectionists will have to just \\""let it go\\"" after a certain point. That having been said, the software IS fun if you are the sort of person who enjoys design software. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",12/26/2006,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Mod Design 1 â€“ Kids Ages 8-14 Learn to Code in Java with Minecraft Â® (PC & Mac) [Online Code],Software,5,2,2,N,N,Amazing,Our sons love this course. Our 8 year old loves everything Minecraft so this was a win-win for us. I sit through the lessons and take notes just in case but they haven't need me or the notes. They enjoy the quizzes and troubleshooting mods just as much as the lessons. We are all always excited to see the items they have designed in the actual game. I appreciate the way that Justin explains it on a level that is easy to understand but continues to use the technical terms so the kids actually learn the coding language!! The skills they are learning have easily transitioned to other formats. Each lesson takes approximately 30 - 45 minutes. Some of the design lessons took longer just because of the creative process. Justin is very engaging in the videos and the lessons are far from boring. The order of each lesson builds upon the previous lesson and offers a quick review. We have no problems with crashing or videos/content that didn't load or play properly. We plan to do many more courses with youth digital.,9/29/2014,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Quicken 2008 Premier [OLD VERSION],Software,1,11,11,N,N,Downgrade from 5-star to 1-star!,"(This is a drastically revised review. My initial installation experience was good, and I rated the program 5 stars. Now I rate it at 1-star.) Here's the recap.<br /><br />I dreaded the upgrade from Quicken 2005 to 2008. I waited as long as possible, then validated my data, etc., and set aside a day when I thought I could stand the frustration. Whaddaya know, the installation went pretty easily, and soon I was up and running, intact, or so I thought. I use Quicken BillPay and have for years, and I have Windows XP Pro. My online billing proceeded normally, and I was greatly relieved. I even submitted a 5-star review. The program does little more than Quicken 2005 did, but the new eye-candy was pleasant, and the upgrade was mandatory. By waiting as long as possible to install, the program was already on Version 7 (God help early adopters!)<br /><br />Then I noticed that my checking account appeared as \\""Wachovia Securities\\"" when the correct account was and always has been \\""Wells Fargo\\"". I tried all the obvious ways to fix it, and nothing worked, so I thought I'd give the new \\""chat\\"" support a try. When it became clear that the things the support person suggested wouldn't work, she simply disconnected!! That solved HER problem. And I decided not to sweat it, since the erroneous name didn't seem to cause any other problems.<br /><br />But then -- I pulled up an old saved report from Q2005, and one column of data was garbage. This time I tried email support. Through an exchange of emails, they advised me to validate the file, and if that didn't work, to supervalidate it. I did all of that (very carefully, I had a backup, but by the way the normal backup you get is worthless, more on that), and it still didn't work. The email guy said I should phone in and talk to a support person.<br /><br />AND THEN I noticed that the validation process had ELIMINATED ALL RECORD OF ONLINE TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OF MY ONLINE PAYEE LIST, which was substantial!! Oh woe. This is when I tried restoring a backup file I'd made the day before. But get this: WHEN QUICKEN 2008 MESSES UP, IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM GOING BACK TO A PREVIOUSLY FUNCTIONAL VERSION. Every old file I \\""restored\\"" now showed the same total absence of online transactions and onlinei payees. Now I did decide to phone in for support.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised: Without a long wait time, I was connected to a young woman in Bangladesh or some other remote location, but she was really really sharp and actually solved the problem. This was not trivial. I had to cancel my online billing setup, validate and revalidate and revalidate the file until no \\""corrected errors\\"" showed up, and then reinstate online billing. We basically took Quicken apart and put it back together again. She also corrected the account so that Wells Fargo showed up instead of Wachovia, although this was separate from the issue that had wiped out my online transactions. As far as the column of garbage in the saved Q2005 report, she said that Q2008 does that sometimes; I should just delete the report and recreate it. All these problems were solved, my online payee list was restored, and at that point, I was charged $24.95 for the call. I tried to argue that Q2008 had created the problem and corrupted my file, but decided to blow it off and just pay and be done with it. I thought my problems were over. Ha.<br /><br />BECAUSE THEN, when I next \\""updated\\"" my online accounts, Quicken Bill Pay downloaded the LAST TWO YEARS OF TRANSACTIONS, roughly 650, along with a few new ones interspersed. The balance in my checking accounted was now -$87,000. That's MINUS $87,000.<br /><br />In the next call to phone support I found out that \\""That's just how it is\\"". I would have to go through the last 2 years of transactions and manually delete the duplicates. (He did tell me to sort the account by \\""most recently entered\\"" instead of by \\""date\\"", so I was able to select groups and delete with only 1-2 clicks per transaction instead of the 4-5 clicks it normally takes to delete a transaction.) At the end of all this, my accounts have been somehow \\""unreconciled\\"" -- all records of the last month's reconciliation have been eliminated. So I'm having to redo that too. I don't actually expect my bank account to balance at the end of all this (How do you carefully and thoughtfully delete duplicate records when you're feeling like !@#%$?) I plan to just enter a fudge factor and forget about it.<br /><br />Here's some learnings: If you're converting from an old version, and you decide to validate the file before you start the conversion, keep rerunning the validation routine until it turns up no more error messages. They don't tell you this, but the sharp woman said that was important. Then you may or may not want to \\""super-validate\\"" which you do by holding down the shift key while you go thru the validation procedure.<br /><br />Then you can pray a lot. If your bank account name comes up wrong, try ignoring it. If your old reports look funny, delete and recreate them. Do anything you can to avoid using the Q2008 version of validation.<br /><br />If you need support, go immediately for the phone support. I talked to 2 people, and both knew what they were doing. The first woman was awesome (except for not telling me the horrors that would happen the next time I ran the online update). The second person, a guy, knew I was, well, screwed, and he tried to be as nice as possible about it. I have used Quicken since 1998, and I will say that support is better than it was a few years ago (not close to the way it was Back in the Day), and they don't charge you unless they solve the problem. The chat and email support were useless.<br /><br />All for now.a transaction.)

Well, almost - I still haven't got the mouse to work in the GUI but for my purposes I really don't need that - I can always vnc in if need be. I did have a little trouble getting the network to work - I wanted it to dhcp but it wouldn't, so I finally just gave it a hard address and all was fine.<br /><br />As it happened, the next day I needed to test something on the latest Centos so I installed that under VMWare rather than Parallels and of course that was 100% perfect - no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />I see that VMWare now has the ability to convert a Parallels install.. I haven't done that yet, but really, why should I run both of these?<br /><br />And Parallels does seem to be a very busy boopy - I happened to be running \\""opensnoop\\"" and noticed that Parallels has a LOT of activity.. I noticed nothing from Fusion during that same period. Now Parallels was running Windows and Fusion was doing Centos, so it might be Windows fault, but I would guess VMWare is going to be more efficient if it isn't already. I think they've just had more experience and resources.<br /><br />I've read many reviews that show Fusion as faster - and I do notice that my XP is slow.. of course XP is often sluggish anyway, but I think I'll be doing that conversion soon.",10/28/2008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It got to me by regular mail 4 days after I placed my order. $19/3 computers = $6.33 per machine for internet security. I previously tested all the major competitor's products in real time for 30 days each. Some passed a lot of malware, some bogged the computer down, some interfered with my e-mail and some allowed viruses to pass. I have run real-time tests with malware scanners and sandboxes on my machines. Of the several products I tested, this one has come closer to a perfect score than the others. My malware scanners come up with zero malware now most of the time and the competing products always passed some each day. This product is the least invasive of any other - meaning it doesn't bother me with pop-ups at all and doesn't slow my computers down. I worry less about malare and viruses now and enjoy my computer time most using this product. It auto-scans each day unnoticed. If I use the scan button, it takes less than 2 min to do a full scan. Add the fact that I got it so cheaply and fast, then I have something to be very happy about. How would I rank the competition? #2 Norton. (it's almost as good), like all the competition the scans take quite awhile. #3 Kaspersky - doesn't bog the machine badly but passes malware. #4 BitDefender - heavy program, does the A-V job effectively, passess malware, uses noticeable computer power. #5 ESET - not a resource-heavy program but I didn't test it as heavily as the rest but it gave me no real problems that I recall. AVG- best of all the free ones. Panda- it passed a Trojan to my machine. IOLO AV, crashes and needs re-install fairly often - I had it for a year. Very weak AV.

By the time I got around to this the product was not returnable at Amazon.com and I was forced, by Amazon, to contact Microsoft for a fix.<br /><br />The Microsoft phone number initially offered by Amazon was incorrect. The second number offered by Amazon got through to a dispatcher who issued a service ID and was transferring me to a technical representative. That line was disconnected during the wait. I called Microsoft again with the ID and was told there would be a 19-35 minute wait. I insisted. Eventually, a representative verified that my original product key was valid, even though it wouldn't activate my software.

Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac - Old Version,Software,4,2,2,N,N,Near Perfect With Boop Camp Partition,"I bought Parallels for Mac because of previous problems with other similar program, VM Ware. In all fairness, the VM product was a beta so I should have guessed it would be buggy, but even the non beta version had its fair share of bugs. Although VM Ware loaded XP home without a hitch, using the program was fraught with difficulties. First, it was slow as molasses in January. Im not taking just a little slow, Im talking go to lunch and maybe itll be finished slow. Secondly, it was prone to mouse failure. Although it would recognize my mouse, it was always at least 2 inches off the mark. If I wanted to click a box I finally learned to position my mouse at least 2 inches below the intended button and then click. Finally, VM Ware allows for the import of an existing Boot Camp partition (see below) but the process is slow and one slight misstep spells doom. For the novice, its intimidating. Then I went to Boot Camp, which is Apples built in Windows capable utility. It worked without a hitch but you had to reboot to either OS X or Windows and hold the option key to get a boot menu. Of note, Boot Camp runs Windows natively, that is, at the same speed as a regular Windows machine. Fact is, it runs quicker on a Mac! All you have to do is go to the Boot Camp utility (under Utilities in the HD icon) and it walks you through it. I got Parallels because I was tired of rebooting my computer to get to Windows. I use Quicken 2008 quite a bit and Quicken for Mac really bites so I do have to use Windows. With Parallels I dont have to reboot. How difficult is it to access the Boot Camp partition with Parallels? Well for starters, it takes about as long as reading this sentence. Once you install Windows into Boot Camp you then install Parallels in Mac. Upon opening Parallels the first time itll ask you if you want to import the Boot Camp partition with Windows on it. Click yes and youll get a desktop icon that states My Boot Camp. After afew minutes of tweaking youll have Windows running on your Mac desktop. Of course, its not all fun and games. For example, youll get a warning that your Windows serial number is no longer any good because of significant hardware changes on your computer. Not a problem. I called the Microsoft toll free number and they issued me a new serial number when I told them what happened. Also, until Parallels recognizes and installs your mouse in the window, youll have to revert to the old ALT routine (the underlined Y in Yes means you have to press the Y key to enter the command. Making things weird is that you sometimes have to hit the ALT or CTRL key, sometimes you dont. Go figure). Also, you must learn to read instructions. Your mouse cursor will be stuck in the Parallels window that appears. It will seem you cant get it out of the box. Read the bottom of the box and itll tell you to hit CTRL and ALT to get the cursor out of the box and back to Mac. It you go to full screen mode, youll have to remember to key in ALT and ENTER to access the Mac screen again (it merely minimizes the window that has XP or Vista in it). By the way, the default memory allocated to Parallels is 512 MB. Some may find this a tick slow and you can increase it to half of your available RAM if you desire (I have 4 GB so I could go to 2). I found 512 to be just about right, but Vista will require at least 1 GB. If done properly, Windows will act just as fast in Parallels on Mac as it does in Boot Camp. I could detect no discernible difference, but there are a couple things to remember: 1. If Windows is open in Parallels, shut it down as you would any Windows machine. Shutting it down by closing the window may make it crash. 2. Maximize the window for best performance. If you use the default window size things get really crowded very quickly. 3. Dont think you can get away using a hacked or cloned version of Windows. Parallels demands a serial number before it will load Windows, unless you import it from Boot Camp and then Windows asks for a serial number. Either way, youre out of luck if you attempt to use a fraudulent copy. For the price I paid (about $20 when I bought my Mac) you really cant lose with Parallels. It works as intended and actually runs Windows better than a Windows machine.",6/13/2008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-File + State 2012,Software,3,4,5,Y,N,"mostly the same, but in some ways it's worse","I've used TurboTax to do my taxes for many years, in some years I used TaxCut (or whatever it's called now). I've generally found TT to be slightly better, but not dramatically so, and therefore have in the past recommended that buyers consider price as an important factor in the decision.<br /><br />This year I'm in the position of being able to compare the Deluxe & Premier versions, and so far can comment in detail on the investment-related features, which is where they differ.<br /><br />But first: if you're not familiar with TurboTax -- it really is a good option for preparing your taxes if you are a do-it-yourself person, comfortable with going to the IRS website or other tax info sources to get answers to questions. No, TT will NOT, despite the grand marketing claims, take care of you if you're not quite sure about the rules or are confused about some little tax detail that's not either simple or common.<br /><br />If you aren't very comfortable with figuring out the rules, then you might want to have a tax advisor available who can answer questions and perhaps also review your return before you submit it.<br /><br />Now to this year's program: it mostly looks the same as last year's, and the basic workflow seemed familiar and easy to follow. I do like the fact that you can either follow the easy guided path (EasyGuide) or navigate on your own. The dowload options for W2s and 1099s are comprehensive (you can find lists on the Intuit website), but note that Paychex is apparently (still) not supported.<br /><br />1. If you have tax-exempt dividends from a multi-state muni fund, TT doesn't allow to enter the fraction or amount of the dividend that's from your state (so tax-exempt in your state return). They want you to split the 1099 into two parts, one for your state and one for the others. This is just DUMB. A product that generates $1.5 billion in revenue deserves a bit more care & attention.<br /><br />2. This year you'll start seeing the complexity that the IRS created with the basis reporting on sales of stocks and mutual funds. The problem is that some sales are \\""covered\\"", meaning that the basis has to be reported to the IRS (using your chosen basis method), and others are reported as sales, but basis is your job. I found that sorting through this stuff is mind-bending and error-prone, to a large extent because of the shockingly poor job TurboTax does at helping you work through this. A simple table-type structure where you could quickly enter, review, and correct all the transaction data isn't hard to imagine. But imagine is all you can do because of the horrible interface you'll get in TT. I even went into the Forms interfaces, looking at the imported 1099B and the 8949 and the Cap Gains Worksheet -- unfortunately it's even harder to work with those.<br /><br />3. If you have investment transactions, you should probably cough up the extra money and get the Premier version. With the Deluxe version the security names & transaction descriptions are not downloaded correctly: For example, \\""1000 shares of XYZ\\"" shows up as \\""EXCH to ABC\\"" in my case with a 1099B. (Being cynical, I'm thinking that this is an intentional feature degrade, to \\""persuade\\"" us to buy Premier.) With a 1099Div, the payer name was simply \\""Vanguard\\"", instead of the name of the fund, which is not ideal because you want the name on the return to match the name on the report going to the IRS.<br /><br />That's all I have for now, I'll try to write an update when I'm done with my taxes. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Note (Jan 27):<br />I found another area where TT doesn't handle things well, but it's likely to be quite rare: I have a foreign bank account, which earned interest. I couldn't find an obvious place to enter (foreign) interest not reported on a 1099, so entered it in the 1099 workflow, filling in the required details. I had already generated a Form 1116 because of mutual fund foreign income. However, TT did not add the new data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one.. It only flagged this during the error check, and essentially said \\""you made a mistake, go do the form\\"". Not what I expected.<br /><br />Note (Feb 16):<br />Another funny thing: I downloaded Vanguard brokerage 1099, and it seems that only the first sale (capgain) transaction was imported. I can't tell easily whether this is a Vanguard glitch or a TT glitch. Either way, watch out for stuff like this seems to be the appropriate conclusion.w data to the existing 1116, or generate a new one..

Let it do it's thing before you move on clicking away. I got lucky when my computer had a meltdown and I lost everything. I had a DVD of some of my work to see how it looked on the TV. It was only 11 minutes long and had several video clips with music and some transitions. I imported it from my file menu and used it as I continued working on my project. I re-rendered this project and it rendered very fast since all the parts of the this segment had already been pre-rendered. This gave me the idea to make my full movies with several DVD's like \\""Acts\\"" in a play. I make a few minutes of my show with all the bells and whistles i want and then render that segment on a DVD R/W and do this until my show is finished. My Dad's Vietnam documentary was broke up into 6 different DVD's. I then import all of them and drag and drop them into my timeline and render the entire movie on one single DVD. If any small glitches exist i fix them but keep that to a dull roar! the whole idea is to keep the overall work load down to a minimum - like re-tracking some music or adding a transition etc... and then I render the entire project. My first disk on the documentary is 59 minutes long with lots of music, tons of video i took on my panasonic mini DV with a lot of transitions and effects. Since all of the segments of my disk were all PRE-RENDERED the whole project rendered very fast and did not CRASH!!! and this has worked on other projects for me as well.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 9,Software,1,2,5,N,Y,Ancient CD-ROM-Based Format with Junk Software on It,"I wasted $70 hoping find a simple color filter to put over my pictures. This program has no color filter, no ease of use--all it functions are not right at its surface for total freedom to use right away: Every button you need to use has to be learned--and its particular location discovered, sometimes--by learning where the designer has hid away...Buddy: Anything you need on this program should be on its desktop window, just a cursor move and one click away: all these extra odd, hidden steps just to get the button to you need are deliberate programming hacks designed to cheat the cheaper program of its chance to do the job well enough to say, \\""Job done!\\"" They want you to check in to whether Adobe's $200+ program--3X as expensive as this program--offers the hope you're looking for: paying Adobe more money to make its designers do a more considerate job meeting the customer's expectations: well, it's 2012, Folks, and simple picture editing Apps for tablet-like desktop layer app-button point-and-click accessibility are out there--so we can just forget about caring whether Adobe's designers care whether they are doing a better job with their programs, or not: the old Adobe CD-Rom era is dead! This Adobe program did not put the buttons on the desktop surface layer where we expect them!--So, don't buy it! Don't even bother with a try: These buttons need a desktop fix-it feature--total re-arragiblility of its buttons, so its buttons can be put up on the desktop layer where they belong: all in one place like a tablet does with it's Apps--Adobe's designers should have known make them movable there already--since Apple's I-Pad has been able to do this since mid 2010: I phones and the I Pad have had rotating carousel surfaces since then--if Adobe needed a desktop surface layer with more space.... Adobe also frustrated this product's usability by putting obscure symbols on the buttons: super-snazzy photo technician noise that just confuses the customer who hoped he would instantly know what to do with the program--just with one look--this Adobe's program can't let you re-name these buttons with regular words, so each time the customer goes back to this software, the memory of the user has to do the work of rediscovering how these strangely-symboled buttons worked last time they were used... These experiences with the product are enough to reject it and they are clearly designed to be part of it to get the disappointed customer to want to dump the cheap program for the next level program up in price--Once Adobe suckers you into buying this cheap one: you'll be on the treadmill for guessing if the next more expensive photo-editing program has all the expected feature for 3X the price!--where a reasoning man is hoping for at least 1/3 the defects, after paying 3X as much! But People, these problems are more easily corrected by spending $0 on Adobe!--that's right: Zero Money! Because Microsoft's picture editing interfaces are simpler and get the regular job done with a more pleasant blue-and-white interface--Adobe's interface is all dark grey and black and just an ugly interface to put you off. Adobe doesn't let you fix the problem by giving you the use color-freedom settings: Why? Because freedom with assignability, naming, or color selection lets you tailor all the machines in the world for a simple intelligent interface everybody wants! Allowing the use Adobe's software not just for a trivial picture editing tasks, but for how to come up with the perfect photo editing App: did Instagram just make a Billion dollars? So, the one who copyrights what he gets to try from an ideal Adobe program with button assignability, naming, and color selection customers makes Adobe jealous. The simple remedy to all this in 2012 is to just ignore Adobe altogether! Go straight to the web/internet/cloud: just try the more intuitive picture editing programs: try Picnic or Instagram--use your right to buy-and-try--it's cheaper there and relatively risk free: skip off-line picture editing for your laptop: don't waste your money on an off-line program like this Adobe--you're just paying an Adobe programmer all over again to do what a Microsoft programmer was told to do: keep the good features off the less expensive CD-ROM: Adobe and Microsoft still live in the CD-ROM age...offering to pay a programmer at Adobe to do what a programmer at Microsoft was supposed to do--all over again--won't be getting Adobe to be filling in any of the deficits the Microsoft programmer left intentionally at his bosses command...Adobe does just like Microsoft-->it works towards the next sale this way: Adobe uses a harsh and restrictive policy on your freedom to buy-and-try--that customer right that almost every business everywhere respects: because customers help business get rid of competitors this way--Adobe's \\""Buddy, if you try it: you buy it!\\"" policy is not the way Adobe should talk to a potential money source...but Adobe's arrogance comes from knowing it has trained and conditioned customers to respect the idea that the customer can't ever open the box: Adobe uses this technicality to bring up another topic: the accusation you copied it!--which Adobe uses as an excuse to keep your money: Quite simply, Adobe should make their software un-copiable, and prosecutible by putting identifying marks in the program to stop anybody from copying it: but the real reason you can't buy-and-try it is: were you to try it, you wouldn't even want a copy of it!--it's junk you'd just want to take it back to get your money back!! This Adobe rip-deal hoping for a dumb package-opening decision is just a check-out counter roach motel: your dollars check in, but they don't check out!--once you take it home and open it, this inferior product is yours: This is sharp-practice software sales, which aims to hard-scam customer money under $100 bucks--Rich companies like Adobe assess fools to be able to take a hit for $100 bucks or less!: figuring fools will be back again to see if giving Adobe 3X the money = Adobe will put only 1/3 the design flaws in this time, again--and proving the gullible customer is now ready to accept a $200+ hit--and still have appetitie for more story of this type, for a return for some more sucker bait: Maybe the $500 program has all the stuff!...don't let them put you on this treadmill of gullibility abuse: Use buy-and-try today on the internet before you buy a CD-ROM: 2012 App programs put these boxed CD-ROM programs to shame--in a 'behind-the-times' category. Cloud-hosted App providers keep upgrading Apps all the time: a better bet to put your money here...",4/13/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Nikon Capture NX 2 Full Version,Software,3,8,8,N,N,"Good, but can be hard to navigate at first, do the 60 day free trial.","I recently downloaded this as a trial program from Nikon and Adobe lightroom 2. Recently I have been spending more time shooting photos and wanted a program to do adjustments. Photoshop is out of the question for me as a hobbyist, so I looked to these programs based on different magazine, and website recommendations. NX2 is a very solid piece of software, it does what a photographer needs to do, if you are into design than you need Photoshop. I really feel like Nikon designed this for the everyday photographer to the serious hobbyist. The interface is a bit different if you have used other programs in the past, but many of the shortcuts are close to other ones, that it should not take you long to get up and running. In comparing this with Lightroom, both offer very similar features,and it really depends on your flavor. Like other reviewers have stated, you can get a free trial from Nikon for 60 days, so get it and play around with it.",1/3/2010,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
INDIVIDUAL Home Design Quick & Easy 2.0 (Windows),Software,4,19,21,N,N,"Easy to use, but not perfect","I went ahead and bought this program based on the reviews and its price. I must say that if you have used any other CAD program or the Visio building stencils, this will be an easy program to learn. I opened the my first drawing and started putting together my new house right away.<br />Creating the rooms were very simple. There were a few times I had to search for an answer (like how to use a jogged wall to create an entry way), but for the most part it was pretty simple.<br />The main gripe I have with this program is the lack of objects. One area that is totally missing is electrical. You can place where lights belong in the house, but there is no objects for electrical outlets, light switches, phone jacks, or cable/Internet connections. I was surprised because I consider these to be major features.<br />The other issue I have with the program is that when you print your layout there is alot of whitespace surrounding your drawing. If you try to increase the image size then your drawing gets placed on multiple pages.<br />Other than these issues I think the program is great. If you are looking for an easy to learn program that will give you the ability to layout your furniture, this program is for you.",3/18/2004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

My only concern at this point is how long the batteries will last since there's no way I'm going to use these without the noise cancelling turned on.",6/12/2006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Kaito KA500 5-way Powered Emergency AM/FM/SW Weather Alert Radio,Electronics,4,0,0,N,N,Kaito 500 Emergency Radio,"I ordered this radio from the World Net Daily Web-store. I had recently signed up to receive their email updates and as a thank-you bonus I was awarded a 50% off discount code. I decided to purchase this Kaito 500 radio. The price I paid was $30.35 and that included shipping. I ordered it on Saturday evening and received it the following Friday morning. The radio was packaged well and when I opened the box I was happy to realize it had been delivered in excellent condition. After plugging the rechargeable battery in per instructions, and cranking the dymo for 1 minute, it powered right up and I was able to tune to my favorite AM station. Although the speaker is small the sound was excellent at a fairly low volume. I flipped to the FM band and that all sounded good too. I haven't tried either SW bands yet but will test those at night. I tested the flashlight and reading light function. Both worked without flaw. I was able to pick up the weather band on channel 1 but it did not pull that broadcast in nearly as good as a smaller weather radio that I have so the weather radio of the Kaito 500 could be much better. The radio comes with various charging cables for cell phones etc. I have not tested this function yet. So far I rate this radio a 4 out of 5 stars due to the weather radio reception issue. I have no serious complaints especially for the price I paid.",9/5/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Sanus Systems LL11-B1 51 x 80-Inch Ultra-Thin Flat Panel Mount for TV,Electronics,3,1,2,N,Y,Low profile mount - but too low profile?,"I purchased this mount because I wanted to mount my Samsung 63\\"" [[ASIN:B003A7X5HU Samsung PN63C8000 63-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV, Black]] as close to the wall as possible, and this seemed to be the lowest mount available with the exception of the Samsung picture frame style mount, but that mount was over $200 and I had qualms about the stability of that mount (just mounts into the drywall - no thanks).<br /><br />I had read some of the negative reviews about this ultra low profile mount where users had a problem with having room for wires. On my Samsung, the inputs are oriented towards the side of the TV, so I figured I'd have plenty of room for wires.<br /><br />Installation wasn't too difficult, but the included instructions were pretty bad. I didn't find out until after installing that they have a video instruction on the Sanus website - I highly recommend viewing before installation. One thing to make sure you do before mounting the TV, is make sure you adjust the strings behind the TV so they hang down low enough (almost as low as the bottom of the TV) that you can reach them. You will need to pull these strings to make adjustments, plug in your inputs, or remove the mount later - so neglecting to adjust the strings prior to mounting, as I did on my first pass, can leave a major headache (I was able to fish them from behind the TV, and I removed the TV from the mount and adjusted the wires correctly and remounted ... again, had I watched the video I wouldn't have made this mistake in the first place).<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Well I have a couple of problems with this mount. The bracket that attaches to the TV grips the top of the wall mount, then is supposed to \\""click\\"" into place at the bottom in order to form a secure mount. Problem is, if there is anything back there at all blocking the TV, it won't click into place. This is the problem some of the negative reviewers who have TVs with inputs facing backwards have - it didn't leave any room for the HDMI or other input cables. In my case, my cables are perpendicular to the TV and don't seem to be the problem. What's even worse than the lack of clicking, is my TV isn't quite flat against the wall - the front of the TV is a little under 2\\"" from the wall on the left side, and a little over 2\\"" from the wall on the right side, for a difference of over half an inch. I think my culprit might be, the wall I have it mounted on is in a spot where an exterior concrete block wall meets an interior wall, with a sheet of drywall over the interior and the drywall has a very very slight (barely noticeable, and in fact not noticeable at all had I never tried to mount this to it) bulge to it. I think that very slight roundness is what is causing my problems with this mount. Yes, I realize this is mostly my own problem as I don't have a perfectly smooth mounting surface - but my point is, this \\""ultra slim\\"" mount by leaving only .55\\"" inches behind the TV leaves you almost no room for error. If there is any obstruction, including wires or anything else, you could have problems.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality of this product is pretty good. The one week spot I would point out, and I haven't tested it for failure, but the mechanism where you pull the strings to release the lock seems pretty flimsy. If this mechanism were to fail, you would potentially find it extremely difficult to remove the TV from the wall. And again, with the extremely low profile of the mount at only .55\\"", you'd have very few options to get back there and try to get the thing loose.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a terrible product, but I have to recommend it with reservations. If, like most TVs, the inputs on your TV face backwards requiring some room for wires, I would look for a mount that isn't quite so close to the wall. Similarly, if your wall is anything but perfectly flat and smooth (get up with your eye next to your wall and look, the imperfection I'm talking about is not noticeableotherwise), this mount could give you problems. On top of that, the flimsy string mechanism would worry me a little bit as well. Finally, if your setup can accommodate an ultra low profile mount and you do decide to buy this product, make sure to watch the installation video on the Sanus website, and if installing into concrete, I'd go out and buy better anchors than what comes with this mount.<br /><br />3 Stars. Under perfect conditions it probably works fine and it does get the TV nice and close to the wall, but frankly I wish I'd just bought a less low profile mount to start with - it would end up looking just as good with much less hassle. I will probably replace this mount with one that has a little more forgiveness, likely one of the cheaper Amazon Basics models that get good reviews.oblems.

Flips Audio Collapsible HD Headphones and Stereo Speakers,Electronics,3,222,244,N,N,Honest review,"I received these headphone straight from Flips audio themselves, I took there try before you buy challenge. I used them over a couple of weeks to them an honest try. I used them as headphones and also used the unique feature and as the name suggests the ear cups flip out 180 degrees to act as powered amplified portable speakers.<br /><br />Here is the break down of the head phones.<br /><br />Presentation.<br /> The overall presentation of the headphones are very nice from the sleek packaging stating all the aspects of the headphones to the ample amounts of padding used to secure the headphones themselves. The headphones themselves are stored inside a semi hard shell. The. Hard shell itself Is more of an egg shape to accommodate the headphones in their folded positions. Inside the case comes the headphones in their folded position and a USB charging cable to charge the battery that is used when the headphones are used in the flipped out speaker position.<br /><br />Build quality<br /> The overall build quality of the headphones are a mixed bag. Some parts are built for use and abuse, like the sturdy metal hinges that are used when folding the phones to store them. While other parts seem just a little too weak for the job at hand. Ie. the pivot points of the actual ear cups have a very slight wobble when you flip out the ear cups to use as head phones. I do not know if they are designed that way or not. Also the headphones are a tight fit, after using them for an extended time the pressure of the head phone can be felt on the temples, even more so if you use glasses.<br /><br />Sound quality<br /><br /> The sound of the headphones are good but not great. The sound range of the headphones seem to be somewhat limited are a bit flat. Mind you all of the sounds are their and can be heard. But the overall mix of the speakers seems to limit what these speakers are actually capable of doing.On the up side they do sound much better when they are flipped out and usedas powered speakers.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />These headphones are descent headphones. But there are a few nuances That seems to keep these headphones from being great. I.e. the tight fit and the limited soundscape of the earphones keep these head phones from being a great pair.<br /><br />I hope this honest review of these head phones help the maker consider some minor changes to these to make these head phones a great pair.<br /><br />But as with all reviews it is up to you to come up with your own conclusion.",9/26/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I wanted to make sure that there wouldn't be interference with our first monitor. The difference between the two monitors is overwhelming! This monitor does not make popping/crackling noises, or that odd bounding noise that my sounds and lights monitor does. In addition, the monitor really picks up the baby sounds well and makes them stand out over the background noise. We play a white noise machine (washing machine noise) and the noise cancelling feature does not eliminate this as background noise- however, it does minimize the sound in comparison to the babies noise in both modes. I cannot begin to say how wonderful the lack of static etc is, not to mention the choice of 27 channels!

Sennheiser Closed Circumaural Hi-Fi Headphone,Electronics,3,4,5,N,Y,"Comparable sound, not comparable comfort to the HD555s","I just purchased these to replace my HD555s at work. Aaaand - I just printed the return label.<br /><br />I love my 555s, but the open design is not ideal for a shared workspace. There's substantial two-way leakage, meaning that, in order to block out my more obnoxious cube mates, I must jack up the volume... in turn contributing to the general obnoxiousness!<br /><br />On the other hand, the 555s are the most comfortable pair of cans I've ever put on, and I can wear them for an entire day with minimal fatigue. I've got some seriously sensitive ears, and even a bit of pressure or displacement becomes very uncomfortable quite quickly.<br /><br />Upon opening, I was immediately concerned with the slightly less space in the cups, and the leather-like padding material (in contrast to the 555's velour-y padding). FWIW, I was aware of the leatherette cups at purchase, and thought I could probably live with it, (hoping they'd not be too sweat-inducing). I had, however, purchased the 448s hoping that sticking with the brand would mean the same voluminous cups. Alas, it proved not to be so.<br /><br />Along with the above concerns, I wasn't impressed with the build quality by comparison. The whole kit was very plastic seeming and the cord was noticeably more flimsy than my triple-5 friends.<br /><br />I gave the 448s an hour. I immediately noticed the outside attenuation, which was a good start, but also noticed a bit more pressure and less room in the cans. Sound was good through the laptop -> E5. Maybe a bit less transparent, but that was expected, and asked for. I didn't experience major discomfort, but I was *aware* of them the entire time, and thinking about how long it would be until I was going to experience cumulative discomfort.<br /><br />Then the decisive moment - I put the 555s on to compare. Ahhhhhh.

They sound great. Full deep crisp sound. There are 3 extra ear pieces to customize the fit from small to large ear canals.

DVR-GUIDE-INFO need to be moved up to where the EXIT MENU buttons are. An analog PAGE UP PAGE DOWN rather than 'sketchy&#34; TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS would add a flowing experience to the remote.

Marshall Hanwell 50th Anniversary Speaker (04090736),Electronics,5,4,6,N,Y,"Best ""portable"" speaker ever...","I had been looking for a good sounding &#34;portable&#34; speaker. I must have seen about 20 different options. I started looking in the $200 USD range, obviously not the Marshall, but the reviews (i.e CNET) of such portable speakers would always make comparison to other better sounding speakers, including the Hanwell.<br />I am quite picky about sound.( I currently have a KEF home theater with a Velodyne subwoofer. I have my own dj sound system with Gemini amplifiers, JBL standing speakers and Mackie sub, AT 50 MX headphones. You get the picture. I am a sound freak.) I am always trying to get a good sounding system for different purposes.<br />So what about my verdict? I used to play the Bose Sound Dock 10 and it sounded so good. Now we own the Bose Soundtouch 30. Bose is really capable of delivering good music devices. The Hanwell is something else.<br />I just got mine. It is not produced by the same Marshall guitar amplifier/speaker company in England but by Zound Industries in Stockholm for Marshall. This company also produces their Marshall headphones which have great reviews too. I am not sure what components they are using but they could be from SEAS, a Danish company nearby with excellent components. I will have to write Zound to confirm this.<br />The Marshall sound is really outstanding as a &#34;portable&#34; speaker, considering you can carry a 23 lb speaker. It is not a speaker you will take with you around town, but is &#34;portable&#34; around the house. I wanted it for an outside dinning terrace, and it's just perfect.<br />As it is a single enclosure it will not give you any type of sounstage, but the mids and highs are good. Nice voice and guitars, and the lows are terrific for the size. It carries 2 6&#34;; woofers, but it sounds like 10 inches subs.<br />I couldn't be happier with my selection.<br />I got myself a Logitech Bluetooth device and it works perfectly with my ipad and iphone.<br />This thing Rocks. It will be good for a small party(dancing included), if it's not set in an open area. I suggest to place it next to the wall and floor, tilted at 45°. This way you get a better bass response and still direct the highs toward the ear level.<br />I used an SPL (sound meter) and at 1 meter it was pushing a very decent 97 dB. That's party level and not good for continuous listening, but it's nice to have it handy for that song that you really love.<br />So, if you want to have the best available sound from a &#34;portable&#34; 100 watt speaker, look no further. The looks are great too. Need Bluetooth? 30 USD and you are set.<br />I loved it so much I have ordered another one to play it in stereo. Now I will have a &#34;portable&#34; party system. Who could ask for more?<br />This speakers are a commemorative item, so they will become collectibles. The original price was 1000 USD. Under $600 they are a steal. They sure sound like a thousand dollars. Thanks Marshall. Thanks Zound Industries. From a grateful sound freak.",1/6/2015,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

Acoustic Research ARi3G 3 3 Device Universal Remote Control Compatible with Apple Products (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,Great control concept with a couple flaws,"I'm giving this five stars purely on function, it is not the best tactile experience and lacts some programming features but fills a nitch that i could not find anywhere else. If you are no longer using a cable STB and watch a majority of video content on the web (I'm using it with a Mac mini htpc) and don't want a 40 button monster remote then this is a perfect fit, Of the three functions, one is your tv which becomes the standard channel up/down volume up/down input select and mute. The next two become your audio receiver or a/v receiver and the last becomes your media device (apple tv or htpc for example). Programming is pretty standard but I could not reprogram the menu button since it is used to exit the programming mode. Other than that the only other problem I have with it is the small throw of the buttons. I could not find the programming code map on the web so if you are wondering it includes a very large tv, av receiver and audio receiver list along with a list of media devices like apple. That is it - no DVD/blue ray for example. This product is all about simplification - it's very small (half the size of a standard universal remote), goes completely black (other than the ar label) when it's not moving (it has a tilt sensor to activate the button LEDs) and limits the buttons to an absolute minimum.",2/20/2011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

What irks me most is this came up highly rated in an amazon search for an outdoor antenna that could pick up uhf AND vhf signals. It is not good for vhf signals, because it has no wide-armed element (I should have known better from my own experience). It only picks up ONE hd uhf station and that is from the public television tower that is a mere five miles away. It is advertised as having a range of 55 miles, but that is nonsense! I am forty miles only from Franklin mountain (el paso) which has several uhf hd channels; there is nothing between me and them, it is a straight, line-of-sight projection; and yet I pick up none of these signals! I actually did better with an old indoor antenna that I rigged up to sit on the roof!! I will go back to that one and sell this on amazon.com I guess.

Electrified UX-21516 Replacement Bulb Only / 69374 for Hitachi Televisions,Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,Replaced my original bulb in my Hitachi 50VG825,"I replaced the bulb in my Hitachi 50VG825 LCD rear projection TV. The bulb was the original and I was surprised how long it lasted. When the bulb finally gave out, I didn't want to invest a lot in this older TV even though it is just like new. I saw bulbs from 29.00 shipped all the way up to the original Philips unit as high as 150.00. Since there are options with the case and without the case, I read the reviews and decided to forgo the case as most people ended up taking the bulb out of the case and putting it in their original case to get it to fit back in the tv properly. There are two wires that are attached with nuts to the bulb, on on the rear of the bulb and one on the side. Be careful with the one on the side. It is not as secure as the original bulb. Hold it firmly so it can't move and tighten securely. The new bulb was noticibly brighter, possibly because mine was so old. It is like having a new tv, even the colors are brighter.

Sennheiser Digital Wireless Headphones,Electronics,5,1,1,N,Y,When you are looking for the best,I am not an expert by any means. I just listen and see if I like what I hear. I found the RS170 to be very comfortable and easy to wear. It took just a little time to get use to where the headphone buttons were but no real problem. Even though the surround sound is digital simulation it is sure good enough for a non expert like me. It also surprised me how quickly the headphones recharged. I have some hearing loss and found that these headphones actually help with clarity of high frequency sounds. All in all I was very pleased with my RS170 and would highly advise giving them a try.

ABLE PLANET True Fidelity Around-the-Ear Active Noise Canceling Headphones,Electronics,1,0,0,N,N,Buyer Beware - Warranty is Just a Joke With These Guys,"I do not recommend buying Able Planet products. I bought a brand new, retail packaged pair of $350 Clear Harmony NC1050 that failed within two weeks. Under warranty, I requested a repair or replacement, per their written terms on the warranty card. What they sent back were a pair of USED Sound Clarity NC510B ($149 - they called them &#34;open box&#34; but the padding clearly was worn down). When I complained they said they don't have anything else that is an equal replacement. After multiple emails, including to their VP of Sales and Marketing, I was promised a new $199 pair. This was still not a fair replacement but they never even sent those! So, buy at your own risk because if your headphones fail, you can't count on this company to honor their warranty or to act in an ethical way.",4/27/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Menu a bit clunky I've had it for three weeks and am still not used to the touch pad. I always end up selecting things I don't mean to. Who needs photos on an MP3 player? I think they just add that to raise the price. I wish there was an 8GB without photo capability that was less expensive. Overall To me the most important thing in an mp3 player is sound quality. That combined with the amount of space and the easy transfer of playlists makes this a good deal. I would buy it again if I had to do it over.,9/28/2007,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Elite Screens Spectrum Series, Electric Drop Down Projection Screen,",Electronics,5,0,0,N,Y,A great screen at bargain price,"I have done a lot of research on screens after purchasing an Epson 5010 projector. That particular projector was a bit past my budget, so I had to cut corners on the screen. I was looking for the best bang for the buck while trying to achieve the best picture possible. I found that in the Elite 100&#34; electric screen. I have owned the screen for about 3 months, but it was only installed 2 months ago. I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing as I was concerned about a few things I had read in other reviews. First, I bought this screen at about half the price that it is now. Amazon had a great deal going right about the time I bought it. I was worried that a &#34;budget&#34; screen wouldn't do my Epson justice but that is not the case. The picture is fantastic. I had read about problems people were having with curling. The sides of the screen do curl a bit, but it does not affect the picture at all. The motor is SUPER quiet, and rolls up and down with an elegance that belies the price. I popped the batteries in, pushed the remote button, and my screen was rolling. I had called Elite for some suggestions on placement, and they were excellent in responding, and even though they do not install screens they offered advice on how to install my screen in a drop ceiling. I leave the screen down to avoid wear and tear on the motor, but it works just like it did from day one. The picture on this screen is better than I could have ever expected, and for a &#34;budget&#34; screen this is just an excellent way to save some money while enjoying your movies in a larger-than-life adventure. At the price I paid for this, this is just an excellent screen. Highly recommended.",7/14/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Sony HTCT100 Sound Bar with Subwoofer - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,4,4,N,N,A great solution for the price,"Pros - Only 2 pieces as opposed to 7 with a traditional 5.1 setup, which also means... - Only 2 wires! A power cord and a wire to connect the sub/receiver to the soundbar. - Decent sound. This is NOT going to sound better or even as-good-as a standard 5.1 system, don't fool yourself. - Price. My wife found these for $250, and that's a pretty darn good price. - Connections. The thing has a LOT of them. Cons - The remote. Seriously, the thing has about 40 buttons and I only use 5, volume up/down, mute, power and input. And crazy enough, even those aren't laid out very well. - Setup. People complain that there is no mid-range or that voice is hard to hear. These are people who obviously have either never set up a 5.1 sound system before or didn't read the manual. By default, the center channel is very quiet and the subwoofer is very loud. It took me about 15 minutes of going through the manual before I finally figured out how to alter those two settings, and now there's no issue with quiet speech or the lows drowning out the highs. - As I mentioned, this does not sound as good as a 5.1 system. Soundbars are for people who want decent sound at a reasonable price and don't want to monkey with receivers or wires snaking through their walls or under their carpet. In that regard, this product is a resounding success. I lament the fact that I don't get a true surround sound experience anymore, but I'm happy that my children no longer pull my speaker stands down on top of them, or futz with my receiver's buttons and throw everything off. It's easy (once you set it up) and it sounds great. You can't ask for much more than that.",10/15/2009,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

K-TOR Pocket Socket Hand Crank Generator Portable Power Supply 10 Watts 120 Volts Made in the USA,Electronics,5,45,54,N,Y,A Handy End of the World Device,"Well folks, 2012 is finally here and some people tell us it's the end of the world again. Are you prepared if something natural or manmade knocks out the power system for an extended period of time?<br /><br />A solar eruption like the Carrington Event of 1859 would fry the planet's electrical grids. Try manufacturing millions of replacement transformers when the world has gone dark; it could literally take years to restore power. Then there's foreign enemies setting off EMP weaponry high in the atmosphere with the same devastating result. Of course, more mundane weather disasters could also knock out power.<br /><br />The K-TOR Pocket Socket along with a battery recharger and rechargeable batteries will give you some solace and keep your battery powered lanterns, CD player-radios, fans, and other devices working. I tested my K-Tor on recharging the batteries in my portable 9 inch DVD player. The good news is that I can relax in my bunker and keep watching my favorite programs on DVD after civilization has collapsed. The bad news is that it takes over 3 minutes of \\""light, easy cranking\\"" for every 1 minute of viewing. Or you can attach your K-TOR to the Lenmar DVDU923 battery pack; recharging it offers a lot more resistance and requires some muscle power, but delivers about 16 minutes of viewing for 5 minutes of cranking. [[ASIN:B0011MZORU Lenmar DVDU923 Universal Li-Ion Battery for Select Portable DVD Players]] A competitor, the ERDVDMAX battery pack provides 17 viewing minutes for 5 cranking minutes. [[ASIN:B00076QBHS Technuity ERDVDMAX Battery, Universal Nimh for Portable]]<br /><br />My initial effort at battery recharging suggests it could take an hour or more of cranking to recharge four AA battteries. Obviously, only an exercise freak would use this device so long as electricity is flowing out of wall sockets. But if/when there's no other source of electrical power, the K-TOR could be worth its weight in gold.",1/2/2012,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Waterfi Waterproof Shuffle 4th Generation 2GB - Best Underwater MP3 Player for Swimming & Water Sports! 5 Colors available,Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,Remember: You Are In Water,I only use that as a title because I think one has to remember they are swimming so the sound quality and such will not be like you are used to when using for 'dry' workouts. Yes there is a tinny sound but it wasn't anything that took away from the fact that you can listen to your favorite music and get a longer more enjoyable swim.<br /><br />I found it hard to adjust to the ear piece that wraps around your ear; partly because it pressed to the back of my head with my swim cap; the ear piece may fall out when you do a flip turn.

"Tecsun PL880 Portable Digital PLL Dual Conversion AM/FM, Longwave & Shortwave Radio with SSB (Single Side Band) Reception",Electronics,3,162,171,N,Y,"Excellent AM and FM, not so good SSB, Sync, or weak signal DX.","There are many things to like about this radio. It appears to be of high quality construction, the tuning knobs have a good feel to them and operate smoothly, and it has a sound bigger than the relatively small size of the speaker would suggest. There are some problems with it, however, mainly related to SSB and weak signal reception. I would urge prospective buyers to research the radio in the Yahoo Groups for the PL-880. It was brought out in the group that there appear to be multiple firmware revisions available, and that batch 8820 is the most recent. Earlier versions had even more problems than the 8820, so do yourself a favor and check.<br /><br />The radio does have sync detection available by pressing and holding either one of the SSB keys. However, sync does not hold well at all, and it also adds considerable distortion. There are multiple filter options available, but SSB is limited to 4 KHz, even when sync detection is activated, which limits the fidelity of the radio. There are also other problems with the current firmware which cause the bandwidth to change when you try to tune a SSB signal, and also cause the audio to jump around when trying to listen to a weak signal. The front end overloads easily with an outdoor antenna, even when the signal is attenuated by using the 3 position switch to cut down the antenna gain.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a good looking radio with a great sound for AM and FM only, I would recommend it. If you will be listening to more Shortwave, Longwave, or SSB, and want a functional sync detector with a reasonable bandwidth for good fidelity, then I would hold off until the design matures more. Also beware firmware revisions 8819 and below at this time. These should be &#34;B&#34; stock and not sold as new.",12/20/2013,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM / FM Portable Radio,Electronics,5,3,3,N,Y,Excellent Portable Radio with Crank Charger,"Having purchased a smaller unit Eaton several years ago, I was prepared to be unimpressed. But this slightly larger unit has far superior tuning, reception and sound quality. I was disappointed to see that it doesn't come with a wall adapter, but later realized that it's not necessary because the crank is so incredibly effective. A brisk two-minute crank literally powered the radio for over five hours! It's so easy there really seems to me to be little reason to install batteries in storage and watch them slowly die.<br /><br />It should be noted that the manual indicates a limit on the total number of manual charges the internal battery can sustain, which means cranking may not be a suitable technique for routine operation! But as a standby communication device it seems just about perfect.<br /><br />I'm quite impressed with the value contained in this nice little package.",4/29/2014,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,0,0,N,Y,Great Clock for the Price,"Needed a new alarm clock, nothing fancy, but had to be dependable with easy to read numbers, yet soft on the eyes. The Sony display numbers are 0.9” tall in a light green LED, which are very good. This Sony device fits the bill with a fairly small footprint (approx 6” wide, 6” deep and 3.25” high). In fact, for the money paid, it comes with a couple of features that, for me, are a bonus. First, it has Automatic Time Set, which is adjusted by your time zone, and should never have to be reset with the built-in lithium battery. With that is a daylight savings time adjustment feature that works automatically with the built-in calendar. This is not a huge deal, but a very nice convenience. But I did get this primarily for its alarm feature and it does not disappoint. There are two alarm settings (A and B) and I use A for weekdays and B for weekends. Nice and convenient. While it does have a snooze control that works, I do not particularly use that feature, but it is there if and when needed. The tuner is pretty good and will, more than likely, be affected by how well AM and FM signals are in your specific area. For me, I am able to capture my favorite few stations.

It just so happened I was in desperate need.<br /><br />I have not had cable for about 5 years now. It was just getting ridiculous. So, like many others, I bought an antenna to get local channels. I tried three or four antennas of various cost, and it was always chopping and crappy. I could never get a solid digital signal. I gave up on ever seeing my local channels again.<br /><br />This antenna, on the other hand, is totally different. It has a pretty good range on its own (despite being paper thin), but it also has a signal booster. It is powered by USB if you have a USB port on your TV (most TVs have this, and it says &#34;for service only,&#34; but it works great); if not, there is a little power adapter you can also attach. The cords are all nice and long.<br /><br />With this antenna, I am getting channels I didn't even know existed in the area.

Grace Digital GDI-IRDT200 Hi-Fi Internet Radio Tuner,Electronics,5,3,4,N,Y,GREAT addition to my home theatre!,"I just received my Grace Tuner the other day, and I must say, this is an AWESOME product. I have been looking into various internet radios, namely the Squeezebox, and did not see anything that looked like it met my needs. When I saw the Grace Tuner and found out I could get internet radio stations, Pandora, and stream my MP3's from my NAS drive, with audio coming through my stereo, I had to try it out. I have the product installed using ethernet because I keep my router with my home theatre equipment (for PS3, XBOX 360, and Kaleidescape) so I cannot speak to the Wifi but every review I have read says the Wifi works great. From the moment I powered it up, it has worked flawlessly. I have located several local radio stations, setup my Pandora account to stream to the Tuner, and connected my Cisco NAS 200 box to stream my MP3 collection. I am using my iPhone as a remote, which is a great FREE feature for this device. The LCD screen, as many have said, is not that detailed, but it is clear and bright. My only gripe would be that when scanning through my 50GB of MP3's, I have to scroll through all the artists or albums to get to the one I want, so if I want to listen to Warren Zevon I have to scroll from the A's to the W's. Would be awesome if the iPhone APP had a search by letter feature for your files.

Very comfortable foam earpads that don't cause ear fatigue over several hours of listening. The only downside is the length of the cable.

GE 24700 Flat Panel Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,1,1,2,N,N,Piece of junk,"Just bought a brand new panasonic passive 3d tv to replace an old sony in which we were still using a converter box. Don't have cable, never have, never will. Anyhow, decided to buy a new antenna. My husband picked up this model @ Home Depot and its junk.<br />When we first installed it, couldn't even pick up channel 49(ION) Had to rescan at least 6 times. Every time you change channels, you have to get up and fiddle with the antenna, I mean everytime! If you're on 26(FOX), flip to 49(ION), antenna won't even pick it up, screen goes black and tells me channel is unavilable. If you're on 49 and flip to a major channel like CBS/NBC/ABC, picture continuously pixilates, sound goes in and out, so jump up and fiddle with the antenna. What's the point of remote control if you have to keep jumping up to move the antenna? Sometimes I just give up and turn it off. I've tried putting it in the window, turning it upside down, horizontal,vertical, antenna all the way up,half way down, all the way down and I only live about 12.7 miles from most of the major towers with no tall obstacles in the way! A couple of them are around 17 miles away, but those aren't the stations I have trouble with.<br />We have a 4 yo HD Magnavox in the bedroom, using a 4 yo,$5 Dollar store loop antenna that gets better reception than this amplified, optimized HDTV GE antenna does. I'd give it a minus 0, if I could. Guess we'll put our old 6 yo antenna back on tomorrow. Good thing we kept it.",10/27/2012,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

David Archy Men's 4 Pack Micro Modal Lightweight Sexy Bikinis and Briefs,Apparel,5,1,2,N,Y,Perfect hot & humid summer underwear,"I normally prefer to go commando in the summertime but for work, when I'm wearing dress pants and a dress shirt, it's not quite so feasible. In colder temps I'll happily wear boxers and in freezing cold long johns, but I really hate the traditional cotton briefs (a.k.a. &#34;tighty whiteys&#34;) as well as their skimpier cotton &#34;bikini&#34; versions.<br /><br />Had never heard of &#34;David Archy&#34; before, but these undies got my attention because of all the glowing reviews here on Amazon, and the description of the material, as well as curiosity about a penis-pouch...a feature I've never had in any of my underwear before. Plus the price wasn't as crazy as some of the others (cough cough, Calvin Klein!).<br /><br />Well, tried them out as soon as they arrived, and a couple hours later, have to say that I am most pleased! The material is soft and breathable not constricting or scratchy like the typical Hanes/Fruit-of-the-Loom or the ridiculously overprice Calvin Kleins. And that pouch, goofy-looking as it is, definitely gets the job done: provides impeccable support and comfort! Yeah I admit I would feel pretty sheepish if I were caught dead in say, a crowded gym's changing room wearing this thing, but I usually put on my gym clothes before heading out the door anyways so that's not an issue.<br /><br />My only concern with this product is long-term durability of the fabric. Have never seen briefs come in individual cardboard containers within a multi-pack, each with its own packet of dessicant beads! And then there's the care instructions on the ridiculously long rear tag (which I promptly scissored off of course): &#34;Machine Wash Cold. Wash with like colors. Tumble dry low. Cool iron. Do not wring. Do not dry clean.&#34; (Who in the world would think of ironing or dry cleaning their briefs???)<br /><br />So, will keep my fingers crossed that the material is not overly delicate. Since I plan to wear them for only a month or two out of the year, that should not be too big of a deal.<br /><br />PS. It's hilarious how many guys are using their Amazon reviews to shamelessly flaunt their stuff in the photos...is Amazon becoming a meat market pickup joint these days? lolshould not be too big of a deal.<br /><br />PS.

These are not &#34;pull on and go&#34; type socks -- they are more of the &#34;sit down and get your toes into the holes one by one&#34; socks.

i play. Baby & Toddler Girls' Rashguard Set with Built-In Absorbent Swim Diaper,Apparel,4,1,1,N,Y,Sizing question mark,This suit fit my baby well and was very durable.<br />I could ask for few minor improvements such as the little design in the middle came off after couple of months of use. Also the bottoms fit tight (which is good as a bathing suit) but hard to put on a baby. I wish there was another option with side closure or something to make it easier to put on and take off.<br /><br />Another thing is the sizing but it may be due to the heat and sun that it stretches.<br />I had purchased a SMALL size when my baby was about 3-months. Now she is 15-months and I purchased the next size. But when we looked at the MEDIUM we received it was clearly smaller than the SMALL we had. We lived in Borneo which is hot and humid all year round. So the heat and sun might have caused the material to stretch but I was a bit confused to see that the new MEDIUM was smaller than my old SMALL.,6/24/2014,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Genuine Leather Trench Coat w/Double breast button closure and belt,Apparel,1,14,16,N,N,This Trench Coat Is NOT Made From REAL leather,"I foolishly purchased 2 of these so-called \\""leather\\"" trench coats on eBay in December 2011; same manufacturer lable (i.e., Giovanni Navarre) except these were size 3XL. After paying about $90 in tailor's fees, when I picked up the coat, the tailor told me that this was not a leather coat, but rather a Chinese imitation of leather. What each purchaser will find out, is that after wearing these coats for 2-3 weeks, and perhaps folding the coat, that the black finish of the coat will start to crack, particularly in the areas of the coat that are bent the most while wearing it (e.g., the arm-shoulder area, the elbows), and will then break/peel off exposing a white, heavy woven-fabric substrate beneath. The slightly elastic, black \\""leather\\"" coating applied to the woven-fabric substrate appears to be some sort of polymeric finish. After reading one of he earlier reviews from another buyer, I asked my tailor why this coat had so much stitching on it so as to make it appear to be made from sewn-together pieces of leather. His response was that this specifically was done to stabilize each sewn coated area from excess movement so as to keep the polymeric finish on the coat. Said he, \\""If you know leather like I do, you can tell just from the feel of this garment that it is NOT leather.\\"" I've been using a balck magic marker to stain the peeled-off coat areas black again and the coat looks horrible.",8/30/2012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I had to wear black undergarments without lines because the lighter color fabric is revealing. I will have to line it with some fabric the next time.

I have two of these: one in blue and one in red (more of a brick-red). Pockets are nice and deep. Fabric is light weight and nice for summer, sort-of a gauze material that requires something under it. But nice for summer layering. This brand is extremely inconsistent. Even with the two dresses, one has an oddly long button placket. The biggest drawback is that one arrived with a sickly-sweet smell. I've washed this twice, the second time with Lysol and scented washing liquid, but the rotten candy smell persists. I am trying scented dryer sheets with copious amounts of fabric odor-neutralizer.

I ended up returning it though, because the high gore was very irritating and gave me rash. Also, I didn't really like texture of the straps, they were not very nice looking and were difficult to adjust.<br /><br />I also wanted to add that Amazon, or whoever packs these bras needs to be more careful, this bra was very wrinkled when I received it and while the outside looked smooth, there were a lot of creases in the inside molding and those can be permanent.",6/21/2013,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

London Fog Little Girl's Gold Fleck Belted Puffer Coat,Apparel,5,1,1,N,Y,Great coat,"I was a little skeptical about buying this coat since there were no reviews to judge the fit and quality. But, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. We bought it a little big for our then 20 month old and it works very well over sweaters. The attached hood is an added bonus for the windy days. The color is neutral but not boring. Plus, there is a place on the inside of the coat to write your child's name. This was a great purchase!",12/21/2014,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Half Slip, Sand18-S",Apparel,4,10,11,N,Y,Great slip for price,"For the price, this slip is awesome. I checked out some slips at Target and the ones at Target felt slightly nicer but they were more than twice the price. I ended up ordering the ones on Amazon because I like the thick lace hem (I think it's sexy) but it's the lace hem that I also took off one star. It has a funny scallop design in the back (I wish the back was the same as the front or that there were a picture of the back so I knew before I ordered it) because the scalloped part makes it really obvious that it's \\""underwear\\"" and not nice looking when it peeks out through a slit of dress or skirt. The slip is also relatively \\""high waist-ed\\"" so it doesn't work for some of my skirts meant to be worn around the hip (I can't just pull it down because then it's too long/longer than my skirts). Also, I felt shipping was a bit high considering it's so light and small but I bought four slips at once so that made it more reasonable. The sand looked more like a pale yellow than the pinkish beige in the picture but it's a beautiful color and I love it.",7/27/2009,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Seamless Padded Bra w/ Transparent Straps & Back,Apparel,4,0,0,N,Y,Worked great!!,"I ordered this bra for a specific dress to wear to a WHITE BALL, out of town.

I was able to pull off the sexy \\""back out\\"" look i was going for and still have the support i needed. I wear a 36 D and ordered the 36C to enhance cleavage. The only reason i didnt give this bra all 5 stars was i did feel the back strap could have been made to be clearer. It was able to be noticed. Maybe they will come out with one that corrects that. Especially for tanned or darker skinned women. But I still looked great!! Thanks Amazon!",7/31/2012,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
